1,0,0,A Community Enterprise
1,1,1,"The University of Hong Kong is now one of Hong Kong's largest single community enterprises. Each year it passes into the working life of Hong Kong and elsewhere 1,200 young graduates in a wide range of academic and professional fields. Its student enrolment is over 5,500, including some 100 candidates for doctor's degrees, and it accommodates almost I,000 of them in its halls of residence. It employs over 500 teachers of high repute, and they and their students and services occupy over 40 buildings of sizes in a range from two to 150 thousand square feet of usable area, in 70 acres of scarce land; and over 350 thousand square feet of floor space have been added in the last two years. It has a bookstock of more than half a million, including one of the largest collections there is, of perennial, ephemeral and manuscript material on Hong Kong. Its invested endowments are worth $260 millions on the market; it is spending $120 millions a year on its regular activities, four-fifths from Government subsidy."
1,1,2,"In addition to what are considered to be the normal functions of a university, it is engaged in large-scale activities as a landlord to most of its senior staff and is planning to increase its stock of owned flats to almost 400 in the next two years; it operates on contract the pathological investigation services for a major Govern- ment hospital of 1,200 beds; and until 1979 it was occupied with examining in the schools, for which it was dealing with not far short of 10,000 examination scripts written by advanced-level candidates. On the part the University has through- out its life played in school examining I have dwelt elsewhere in this account."
1,1,3,"In the recesses of Hong Kong countinghouses, the University of Hong Kong, in common with universities generally, has from time to time been accused of living in an ivory tower. What connotations does the term 'ivory tower' carry? What impression does it seek to convey? Is it not that the University is elegant, cloudbound, ornamental, superfluous and ineffectual, expensive but impractical, enchanted and held in thrall, remote, opulent? That therefore it can have little relevance, if any, to a Hong Kong which has both feet set firmly on the ground, which is free but disenchanted, at the hub of a busy universe concerned only with practicality and cost-effectiveness? So from time to time the University takes stock of itself and of its products, as other universities do, seeking to parry those unkind, ill-deserved thrusts and to pierce the tissue of contemptuous innuendo, mustering what testimony it can find at hand for its defence."
1,1,4,"A general sort of survey was made in 1974, between classes so to speak, from written sources such as the Government Blue Book, and from material produced by individual teachers in response to an invitation to look at their own contribu- tions to the community as citizens and experts. The results reveal how deeply enmeshed with its community the University is, and I summarize them here as a lesson not only in the extent to which a well-established university, wherever it may be, enriches the community from which it draws its living, but also of the low-key diffidence with which a university distributes its wealth."
1,1,5,"The Blue Book for the 1st January 1974 gave a glimpse of the staff and graduates in their place as citizens of prominence, as officials, and as members of official bodies. Almost all the 110 official Government boards and committees listed contained at least one of the University's graduates and each of 25 of them a member of its teaching staff; among the 351 Justices of the Peace appear the names of 64 graduates and seven staff. The Executive Council included four graduates-two in medicine, one in arts, and one in engineering; in the Legislative Council were also four, and one ex-student-two in arts, two in engineering, and one in medicine-and of these, three were Finance Committee members. One of the elected Urban Councillors was a graduate. Among the 1,137 local residents upon whom honours and decorations had been conferred were those of 58 graduates and ten members and ex-members of the staff. So much for the Civil Lists; though it should be added that the present Vice-Chancellor is now an unofficial member of the Legislative Council and one of the teachers is a member of the Urban Council."
1,1,6,"Many other graduates hold responsible jobs of a generally public nature in the government administrative and professional services, in colleges, schools, and hospitals. There are some 150 officers in the Government administrative service, more than half of them local: of these four in five are the University's graduates. One of the engineers was general manager of the Canton-Kowloon Railway; by 1974 three had reached eminence in government service-one as Secretary of Home Affairs, one as Director of Medical and Health Services, and one as Director of Housing, two of them having taught on the staff. Another is Deputy Secretary of Finance. Half of the Directors of Medical Services since the re- occupation of Hong Kong in 1945 have been the University's medical graduates; it was an arts graduate who was the first of the local officers in the Government administrative service, and who became Commissioner of Labour by the time he retired."
1,1,7,"Manning the City District Officer scheme in 1974 were nine in high office, eight of them local and six of these the University's graduates. Of the Presidents in the three foundation colleges of the Chinese University one was a graduate and one a teacher; both the Secretary and Librarian of that University and one of the Assistant Directors of the Polytechnic are graduates and were on the staff; the Councils not-only of the University of Hong Kong, but also of the Chinese University and the Polytechnic boast the University's graduates as Chairmen, each with a Knighthood; members of the staff have served and some still serve on the colleges' Boards of Governors and have acted and do act as external examiners from time to time. Of the 7I secondary schools presenting candidates for the Advanced Level Examination 27 have principals who graduated from the University. Some of the graduates are employed writing film and television scripts and stage plays in Chinese; one is executive director of the Consumer Council. Medical graduates are superintendents of 20 hospitals. Others hold responsible positions in the law, in the church, and most other professions and callings."
1,1,8,"There are more of the graduates than can readily be enumerated who hold honorary offices of one sort or another. Four, for example, were in recent times presidents of the Law Society, the Institute of Architects, and both the British and the Chinese Medical Associations. One, a graduate then on the staff, was honorary adviser to the City Hall museum-as others are now-and also conducted the Philharmonic Orchestra; several of the teachers act in editorial and advisory capacities for local as well as international professional journals; others have attained eminence in the Masonic Orders or are active members of church councils. Many are the members of staff who are governors of schools; some deliver addresses at school speechdays and to lunch clubs, appear on TV forums, and hold public seminars. The clinical professors are honorary consultants to the Government and some of them to the Armed Forces in Hong Kong. Since the University Press was established in 1954, over 60 of its published books have been concerned specifically with Hong Kong matters. The University-its graduates and teachers-invests every fibre of the fabric of Hong Kong society and Hong Kong institutions."
1,1,9,"About seventy of its teachers render consultant services over a wide range. Consultations completed or started during 1974 form an impressive list. Thou- sands of specialist clinical consultations are annually given on cases referred by doctors in private practice and by the Government and Armed Forces, in the fields of pathology, paediatrics, internal medicine including infectious diseases, dermatology, neurology, tuberculosis, psychiatry, surgery, including diseases of the ear, nose, and throat, venereal diseases, orthopaedic conditions, and obstetrics and gynaecology."
1,1,10,"For the manufacturing industries quality control schemes are fOJ;mulated, products designed, finished prototypes tested against British Standard Specifica- tions, instruments and gauges calibrated. Advice is given on room acoustics and the elimination of machinery noise and vibration, minerals are tested or identified for a variety of needs, valves tested in water-supply systems, causes of failure of materials in components or whole systems investigated, local food products tested for micro-organisms, local marine food products tested for traces of fuel oil. Advice is given on factory administration and management, on control systems, on trading and marketing policies."
1,1,11,"For the construction industries and in structural and architectural design advice has been sought on the recommissioning of a hill railway; design and supervision is provided on the construction and finishing of complete buildings; building materials are tested, both natural and manufactured, and also structural members and complete structures, including flyovers, sometimes by means of scale models. Special techniques in concrete construction are investigated, urban development planned, advice tendered on the architectural effects of landslides, geological investigation made of building sites; analyses are made of rock samples taken from pilot tunnel projects, consultations invited on general architectural, interior design, landscaping, civil engineering, building, structural, and soil engineering problems."
1,1,12,"On pollution difficulties members of the staff have analysed and interpreted effluent to air quality, consulted on noise pollution, made a feasibility study for sewage treatment and disposal, made inspections preceding the issue of licences in respect of radio-isotope work; have carried out radiological measurements, have tested for fuel oil in sediments and water bodies, have analysed chemically marine diesel oil deposited on beaches as the effect of spill."
1,1,13,"For a variety ofclients members of the staffhave also advised on the training of mining technicians, provided in-service courses for technicians of high grade, supplied prepared specimens to microscope agents, supplied kit-sets of cut and polished rock-samples to schools, made a variety of chemical analyses and interpreted the results, read and advised on typescripts of textbooks and novels, and made bacterial diagnosis of rare diseases. In 1976the Department of Law organized a voluntary legal aid advice service operated by law students and staff and with the assistance of volunteers in legal practice; in the same year it was calculated that in the Queen Mary Hospital alone, as one of several hospitals participating in the medical training curriculum, University departments were treating 65 per cent of all patients admitted."
1,1,14,"The University also organizes annual refresher courses for medical graduates of Chinese universities and others who are not registrable for practice in Hong Kong, and the members of its staff assist in examining them for inclusion in the local register. It employs full-time teachers whose energies are devoted, with the assistance of a large panel of part-time tutors drawn from the community, to mounting over 450 extra-mural courses for over 14,000 adult members of the Hong Kong public each year. It organizes public lectures at the average rate of about one each month delivered by visiting scholars of international renown. Its appointments service helps not only students to find jobs but employers to recruit graduates and potential employers to define their needs."
1,1,15,"The Vice-ChancellorJs Report for 1976-77 lists almost 200 public bodies and committees on which members of the staff were serving outside the University itself, in many cases as Chairmen. In addition to all these community functions, in addition to the teaching and examining and administering which occupy the daily life of the academic, in addition to the thrall of some 120 committees which guide this daily life, the teachers managed in that year to publish not only over 450 articles in the learned and professional journals, but some 25 monographs and books in English and Chinese, ranging from a short monograph on crop physiology to a two-volume union catalogue of Hong Kong's library holdings, from Hong Kong taxation to aerial photography, from low-cost housing to Chinese blue- and-white porcelain."
1,1,16,"There is nothing extraordinary in what I have been at pains to show in some detail. These are the normal activities of a university's graduates, and of its teachers outside the classroom, committee meetings, and examination halls. They are the responses of sensitive people to requests for help and to the need for information. They are not proclaimed to the sound of trumpets, and being taken for granted assume importance in the public view only when there is the risk that they may be curtailed or stopped. U nti! the wartime Occupation the University's activities were small and directed chiefly at China; now they are large and concentrated on Hong Kong."
1,1,17,"Some graduates are overseas. The number is comparatively small, and they have achieved in proportion the same distinction and engaged themselves in enriching the community life in other countries in much the same way as they have in Hong Kong. There are mathematicians who studied under Professor Wong Yung-chow at the University now occupying full professorships at Yale and Princeton and several other universities in North America. Of the first group of architecture graduates in 1955 studying with the late Professor Cordon Brown, one has become Canada's most distinguished architect. One of the early arts graduates was Chief minister of Kedah State, one headed the inland revenue department in Malaysia, and another became deputy speaker in the Singapore Assembly. A graduate who died not long ago was a highly respected full professor of the history of science and civilization in the National Tsinghua University at Peking. A graduate of 1942 is now head of the history department in Chungshan University, a specialist in Tibetan history. Others are working with the United Nations in New York as interpreters; many teach Chinese in universities in America and Australia; the language of the Esquimaux preoccupies one who holds a senior fellowship at the Sorbonne in Paris; another has occupied a Chair of Chinese at the University of London School of Oriental and African Studies and joined the Chinese University of Hong Kong as head of its department in 1978."
1,1,18,"There is also another side to the coin. Many eminent local citizens who would otherwise not be counted among the University's members play a significant role at the very heart of its decision-making processes. Two-thirds of the members of the Court, the supreme governing body, are lay members; and the membership of its executive body, the Council, is weighted in favour of lay representation. Both have lay Chairmen and the Council has fathered many committees on which lay members sit. The citizens in this way take their place in the legislative and review functions of University bodies, in guiding its lines of development and determining the directions in which its money is spent and in appointing its staff. Nor are these duties, in many cases onerous, announced with public fanfare; but they are as much benefactions as are donations to University funds, though not so easily expressed in quantity, and the readiness with which they are assumed is itself a measure of the public's faith in the University, the confidence that it will not fail to satisfy the community's need for the services it offers."
2,0,0,Revolution in China
2,1,1,"Although the present educational role of the University is to supply versatile citizens and civil servants to Hong Kong and professional people of a high cultural and social awareness, it was originally founded in direct response to the explicit needs of China for modern technology and a clear understanding of the Western temperament, and has not entirely lost the flavour of its origins, in spite of the wide difference between its early object and its present directions."
2,1,2,"Its founding in 1911? by Sir Frederick Lugard and others, expressly to help in a Chinese renascence, was in some degree part of a more general competition among foreign powers interested in securing strong educational footholds in China itself. Thus, without an outline reference to some aspects of the earlier story of China's relations with the West not only the reasons for its founding cannot be unfolded, but also many of its activities in its first three decades of existence may not be readily understood. We must begin the account with the suppression of the Taiping Rebellion in 1864."
2,1,3,"The Rebellion started what has been seen in the short view as an invitation to the foreign vultures hovering over China to land and gorge themselves, and in the long view as China's intellectual renascence. The Taipings were suppressed through the intervention of Britain and France, and in return these powers were granted travel concessions, extraterritorial rights, and permission to make Chris- tian converts among the Chinese. In the wake of these licences, treaties were also signed with America and Russia. The foreign scramble for footholds in the Chinese system began in earnest, drawing its very strength from China's own introvert resistance to modernization by external methods, which was denying her the new military techniques and the modern armament which she needed to mount an effective defence, and to keep the full independence and the international respect due to so large and so ancient a nation. The suppression of the Taipings opened half a century of dawning awareness that China must come to terms with the West, must learn how to measure up to the stranger if she was to defend herself against aggression and the partition of her vast potential among foreign powers."
2,1,4,"The presence of foreigners with their fingers in the Chinese administrative system was tolerated until the Second World War, when the old power structure was dismantled and reconstructed in its new and distinctive form. China's dilemma was that, while she needed to learn and adopt Western sciences and methods and naturally wished to provide for her own progress on her own terms, the teachers of the new technology equally naturally set conditions of their own, demanding concessions each one of which, in the granting-mostly in response to shows of force-eroded her international respectability, and once granted, her indepen- dence. The interaction of desire with distaste accounts for much of China's vacillation in her irresolute foreign relations, for the contradictions between word and deed in her administrative and educational systems, and of course for her growing vulnerability to foreign interests and aggression. The total defeat of Japan by the West in 1945, and the spread thereafter southward through China of a resolutely unifying form of communism, which had taken root in the north, put an effective end to this weakness."
2,1,5,"The nineteenth century was a time of great expansion of the activities of Christian missions in the Far East. However respected its antiquity, China was seen from the West as a retarded nation, moved by moralities little comprehended and therefore indefensible, in dire need of new directions and the sort of help the missions were there to offer. From their new wealth, Western industrialists were able to provide lavishly enough for the missions in the East to expand, as much with trade outlets as the hereafter in view. The missionaries took Western medicine with them and insidious glimpses of other sciences, a dedication to the educational process, and sympathy, but of course a very different sort of logic."
2,1,6,"Though they were not everywhere taken as seriously as they intended, it was largely the missions which prepared the Chinese ground for the seeds of dis- content; and in the official mind they came to be thought of as the vanguard of conspiracies to establish spheres of political influence."
2,2,1,"It is generally held that the national universities in China developed from provincial centres of advanced (what we would now call secondary) learning called the Shu Yuan or Colleges, which had been opened mostly with grants of land made by the imperial government between the tenth and eleventh centuries for the study of the Chinese classics, history, literature, and philosophy. At the time Western civilization came into direct conflict with China during the Taiping Rebellion, several were still surviving."
2,2,2,"The Rebellion brought the impetus needed for the formation of the Chinese Imperial Maritime Customs as an international force; at its head Sir Robert Hart played a leading part in preparing the country's leaders for the appearance of a regenerating drive, with the winds blowing in from the West. In 1862 a foreign-office interpreters' school was established as Peking College at an elemen- tary level, much the same as the T'ung-wen-kuan already existing at Canton but closely connected with the training department of the Customs. From 1867 and while the College was in the process of reorganizing, there grew a movement to turn it into a Western-style university variously referred to as an 'Imperial University', a 'College of Western Sciences and Literature', a 'University of Peking', and more grandly still a 'New University of China'. Hart's backing was obtained, and much propaganda put about to the effect that he was the move- ment's leader. It was, it was said, a positive and practical step to import into China Western learning at the highest level, and Hart had himself persuaded the Government to open such an institution. In the event no such thing happened for another forty years; the interpreters' college simply reopened in Peking in 1870, with some extensions.{Baron ]ohannes von Gumpach said in The Burlinghame Mission, 1872, that 'no University, no institution resembling a university, no College of Western Science, Art, and Learning does exist, or has existed, either in Peking or elsewhere in China'. This is the oddest of polemical collections, in which one chapter seeks to prove that Hart's efforts for a New University of China were fraudulent and part of a long political manoeuvre to ingratiate himself with the Imperial Council.} Until 1902, when the College was merged by Imperial decree in the Imperial University, Hart had the task, as Inspector- General of Customs, of nominating to vacancies in the teaching staff, and often temporarily detached his Customs officers to teach there."
2,3,1,"The reform of the educational system and the syllabus of the official examinations was seen as the heart of all spasmodic attempts to modernize China's defences against political disaster. The Council of Foreign Affairs sought in 1866 to set up a college for the cultivation of the Western sciences, among many such moves. To the modern Western ear one of the questions it asked itself then, voices a criticism of the educational system which could not possibly have been more clearly put. 'Why is it', the Council asked in a memorial to the Throne, 'that the book on the Chao-liJ on the structure of chariots , has for some thousands of years been a recognized text-book in all the schools?'. {Charioteering was one of the ancient arts; the others being good behaviour, study, archery, music, and (occasionally) mathematics.}"
2,3,2,"Nothing practical was achieved. Memorial followed memorial from the pens of high-placed and conscientious reformers, urging the introduction of mechanics and mathematics into the official examinations, but to no purpose. At the ceremony held on the 1 st October 1887 inaugurating the new Hong Kong College of Medicine for the Chinese, the first Dean bemoaned the lack of positive action:"
2,4,1,Twenty years ago the Taiping Rebellion was suppressed. Those of us who were in China then thought that surely now a new era is beginning; and we waited from day to day and year to year for what is called the opening of the country.
2,4,2,"In imagination we saw a network of railways and telegraphs rapidly spreading itself over the land; hospitals and schools of science rising in the towns; public works going on everywhere; there was to be better government, better food, better clothing, better houses, more security and comfort for everyone. Everything was to be squared to the foreign model. ... The desirability of all this was very manifest to us, and we could not understand why it was not set about immediately."
2,5,1,"During a vacation visit to China twenty years later Sir Charles Eliot, then Vice-Chancellor of the newly-opened University of Sheffield in England, wrote that he had heard 'great talks ... of reforms and representative government. Boards and Commissioners are appointed to study foreign constitutions, armies, and systems of education. Everyone is reporting on something or other, and the officials of the Empire seem likely to turn into living Blue Books'. But even by then he saw nothing that encouraged him to expect action. 'I am not sure', he commented, 'that all this indicates a real desire to do anything, for I have been an official myself, and I know that the object of asking for a report on a question is generally to get rid of it'. {Letters from the East, 1907}"
2,5,2,"Together with the scramble of the Western powers for spheres of influence in China and China's growing hostility to the presence of foreigners on her soil, two other processes of importance were taking place in the effort to introduce modern reforms. One was the speed with which the enlightenment, military might, and prosperity ofJapan bloomed once its Imperial Court had opened the gates to the methods and results of Western progress; and the other was China's official intention to import Western knowledge on her own account, and her attempt to achieve this by sending large numbers of her young intellectuals to study abroad for extended periods."
2,6,1,"There had been friction between China and Japan for many centuries over the control of the Korean peninsula. At a time when Korea was the vassal of China there was a mutual agreement that neither, to put it into the simplest terms, would despatch forces into Korea without first informing the other. This agreement remained effective until 1894, when China supplied reinforcements in response to an appeal of the King of Korea for help in suppressing a rebellion without first informing Japan, whereupon the Japanese sent in a strong punitive force and defeated the Chinese detachment. As recompense for withdrawing and declaring Korea independent, Japan took a number of prizes which included Formosa and the Liaoting peninsula. As recompense, in return, for arranging the restitution of the peninsula to China the Russians were given permission to extend the Trans-Siberian Railway across Manchuria to Vladivostock with a branch line to Dalny (later Dairen) near Port Arthur. In 1898 the Russians then forced through an agreement that they should acquire a twenty-five year lease of Port Arthur and its neighbourhood and rights to construct a rail link from the Trans-Siberian Railway terminus through Newchwang to Harbin. The same year, in reprisal for the assassination of two of its missionaries, Germany invaded Tsingtao and among other prizes won a ninety-nine year lease of Kiaochou, the territory surrounding Tsingtao. Railway concessions and a ninety-nine year lease of the Bay of Kwangchow as a naval base fell to the French. The British in Hong Kong acquired the New Territories for ninety-nine years and Weihaiwei for as long as the Russians were in Port Arthur."
2,6,2,"The ease with which these concessions were acquired led to further demands in what were called the Treaty Ports: by Japan in the southern ports of Amoy and Foochow; by Russia in Newchwang; by Germany in Tientsin; by France, Britain and America in Shanghai; and by Japan, Russia, Germany, France, and Belgium in Hankow. The West, with the despised Japanese now lying alongside, had penetrated in force into a China closed to progress and outside influence by an arrogant foreign policy since the eighteenth century. If its weaknesses, now revealed in full display, were not to invite still further demands, China needed to make its most determined efforts to modernize, and to regain her self-respect and her independence from the importunities of foreign powers."
2,6,3,"The reformers had long been seeking opportunities. Many of them were Cantonese, generally regarded as from a most contumacious province. Canton was far from the Throne. Hong Kong was farther still, and always a convenient place for intrigue and refuge. Many were known to have had close connections with the Christian missions. In Peking the Cantonese K'ang Yu-wei formed his Reform Club and in 18g8 gained the young Emperor's support for a Hundred Days of Reform, to include wholesale and precipitate changes in the examination system and syllabus. Affronted by moves she saw as a conspiracy to overthrow the Manchu Dynasty, the Dowager took the Emperor into custody and disbanded the Reform Club by executing seven of its most prominent heads. K'ang fled to Hong Kong, where he heard of the sorry collapse of his movement and started a long exile. Reinstating the old examination system and syllabus, the Dowager threw a sop in the direction ofreform by founding the first modern Chinese univer- sity-the Imperial University with eighty students-and modern secondary schools in some of the provincial capitals, which by a further edict of IgOI were to be developed into a system ofNational Universities on the Imperial University model."
2,6,4,"In the South Dr Sun Yat-sen, another Cantonese and son and husband of Christians, had tried out his wings in an attempted armed occupation of Canton in 1895, only three years after graduating from the University of Hong Kong's own forerunner, the Hong Kong College of Medicine for the Chinese, a hotbed of young revolutionaries. Sun's attempt failed and he took flight as an outlaw to Hong Kong, whence he fled to England. {Its history has been traced in some detail in papers by Lindsay Ride, and in the essay he contributed to B. Harrison, ed., The First 50 Years, pp. 6-22.} It was while he was in London that occurred the well-known kidnapping, and his release from the custody of the Chinese Embassy in response to the loud public indignation aroused by Drs Cantlie and Manson, his former medical teachers in Hong Kong. From England he went to Japan to seek support there for the cause of Chinese reform and republicanism."
2,7,1,"Meantime, hostility to the foreigners in China was fast growing. The revival of an old society under its new name of the Boxers provided the focus for the expression of anti-foreign feeling in positive actions, and the first took place in Shantung in reaction to the German invasion. Constrained by no official condemnation from the Throne, the Boxer movement gained in force until 1900, when foreign embassies and the lives offoreigners living in Peking were imperilled. Some were murdered and most of the rest assembled in the British legation, to which the Boxers laid siege. An expeditionary force of allied foreign troops was rapidly formed in Tientsin and despatched to Peking to relieve the legation. The Empress Dowager fled taking the Emperor with her, and when the smoke had cleared they returned to Peking to accept the terms imposed by the Allies. With this, the Boxer movement was at an end."
2,7,2,"The foreign terms imposed upon China demanded full reimbursement of the costs incurred by each of the governments in providing expeditionary troops for the relief and continuing protection of its nationals, and of the losses suffered by foreign individuals during the uprising. The total of the Boxer Indemnity was ?65 million to be paid within thirty-five years from 1902, including ?11 millions for Britain, a purse upon which the University kept a watchful eye for many years."
2,7,3,"Russia continued reinforcing its position in Manchuria; by 1903 it had completed its railway through to Port Arthur and posed a new threat to the security of Japan and to Japanese influence in Korea. The next year a war erupted in Manchuria between the two nations, and in 1905 Russia was defeated by Japan in the field. The defeat of a major Western power by an Eastern nation using Western technology was a new sort of practical lesson for China, and opened the door to reform a little wider. A series of Imperial Edicts issued during 1905 and 1906 ordered a restructuring of the administrative system, the re- organizing of the army and navy, and the reform of the education and examina- tion systems. A central parliament was to be in session by 1915, a date later brought forward to 1913; and in preparation for this, torture and the taking of opium were forbidden and plans laid for long additions to the internal railway system. The first Ministry of Education was formed and the old competitive style of examination abolished. At the time the Dowager and the Emperor Kuang Hsu died in 1908 and the child Emperor was enthroned, one experienced foreign estimate of literacy in the north was one per cent of the population; another put literacy in the south at not more than three per cent: a narrow enough base upon which to erect a modern China."
2,8,1,"From the end of the Sino-Japanese War the predominant influence in the Chinese educational system had been Japanese. The Imperial University at Peking, upon which other national universities were later modelled, was organized in the Japanese pattern and included mathematics and science in the curriculum. The demand for admission to foreign schools and colleges both inside and overseas, including the Anglo-Chinese schools in Hong Kong, was growing apace, by far the largest numbers being in Japan, where there were variously reported to be 11,000 students in 1905, 13,000 in 1907, and 15,000 in 1908, after which the numbers in Japan rapidly descended."
2,8,2,"At a meeting held in Tokyo on the 13th August 1905 to welcome Dr Sun, a new united republican party was born, in which a number of reform creeds were accommodated, under the name T'ung-meng-hui, the Sworn Brotherhood. The party later came to be called the Kuo-min-tang, to which its present-day descent in Taiwan still adheres. Among those in Hong Kong who immediately joined the new party was Li Shu-fan, then still a second-year student of the College of Medicine. He took the oath of allegiance not far from the Alice Memorial Hospital where he was studying, administered in an attic office above the China Daily News before Chan Siu-pak, who had just been elected president of the Hong Kong branch of the united party."
2,8,3,"Before establishing himself in Hong Kong for his further studies Sun Yat-sen had made contact with many young radical reformers who belonged to the Sanhohui, a large anti-Manchu triad in Canton, and brought to Hong Kong with him his first half-formed thoughts of Chinese reform. Chan Siu-pak, of whom we shall hear more, the son of an enlightened father who was also a Christian convert, was the first student to be enrolled in the Canton Christian College as a youth of eighteen when it was first founded in March 1888. He had heard with interest of Sun's developing ideas on reform, and paying him a visit at the College of Medicine in Hong Kong became so impressed that he dropped out of the Christian College and enrolled in the College of Medicine in order to be in daily contact with Sun, leaving with Sun but without completing the course when Sun graduated in 1892. In the College of Medicine Chan joined Sun and two other reformers, Yau Lit and Yeung Hok-ling, under the name of the 'Four Great Outlaws'. With Sun among the first group enrolled in the College of Medicine in 1887, but graduating a year after him, was Kwan King-Ieung-we shall hear more of him too, in the course of the story of the founding of the University. Visiting Hong Kong in 1923 and invited to address the students, Sun recalled his student days at the College, when after his lectures and after reading his books he strolled along Hong Kong's streets and contrasted the orderliness of everything he saw with conditions in Heungshan, where he spent his vacations in the family home, and where there was lawlessness and disorder. He concluded that the differences arose in deficiencies of government-'Why not change it? Why could we not imitate the same thing and change the government?' he asked himself."
2,8,4,"It was on Sun's orders that Chan established in Hong Kong the China Daily News (Chung-hua jih-pao), the first Chinese newspaper openly to advocate revolution and the overthrow of the Ch'ing dynasty, to the great and constant embarrassment of the Government of Hong Kong. Immediately the T'ung- meng-hui party was formed in Tokyo, Chan was elected president of its Hong Kong branch and became less overtly politically active, relinquishing his editorship to the Tokyo-trained militarist C. C. Li, son of the party's treasurer in Hong Kong, Li Yuk-tong."
2,8,5,"There was scarcely a student returning from Japan who was not sympathetic to the revolutionary aims of the T'ung-meng-hui. This was true of students studying elsewhere overseas; and this was one of the two reasons for the almost continuous absence from China of the revolutionary leader Sun Yat-sen, who was engaging himself in preparing them for their return as the new leaders educated in the modern world, at the same time soliciting funds for the promo- tion of his cause. While the revolutionary party was being re-formed in Tokyo by Sun himself, its young adherents who had returned to China were being recruited as officers into armed forces, as part of the reorganization and strengthening ordered by the Emperor in the edicts issued in Peking. Many others were taking up teaching positions in the upper levels of the expanding educational system. A memorandum to the Governor of Hong Kong in September Ig08 from the Consul-General at Canton said that in Canton's Provincial College, which was a tertiary institution, all subjects but foreign languages were taught by Chinese professors, 'the majority of whom received their training in Japan'. Decapitation awaited those in China who were discovered to be members of the new party. As Dr Li Shu-fan wryly put it, 'it was of paramount importance to the con- spiracy that the society's agents gain positions in the regime, although this was like ""playing in the tiger's mouth"" '. Dr Sun frequently travelled under an assumed name and in disguise to escape detection. In his autobiography Dr Li recalled that in 1g07, when he was in his fourth year at the College of Medicine, he was summoned with C. C. Li to report to Dr Sun who was a passenger in a French ship anchored in Hong Kong harbour, passing through after the abortive attempt at rebellion in Kwangsi. They had some difficulty in tracing him because he had an assumed name they had not been given, but finally tracked him down in a cabin, where he sat disguised as a Japanese in a kimono with a blue flower pattern."
2,8,6,"Students in the exodus to Japan had been mostly the sons of wealthy families, as most of them had to pay for themselves. In the 1870S an earlier government experiment to arm some of the students with a Western education in the United States on scholarship had ended in their recall when it was reported that they were becoming denationalized-getting their 'veneer of foreign manners badly laid on a Chinese framework', Lugard later called it. The move- ment to Japan came under official displeasure on the pretext that the students became either dissipated or revolutionary. A crop of edicts in 1905 reminded students that they were expressly forbidden to concern themselves with political movements, and reflected only too clearly the nervousness with which the authorities in Peking viewed the activities of Dr Sun overseas and the malign approach of the new enlightenment they so desperately needed. At the same time the Ministry of Education in Tokyo, inspired by pressure from a Chinese govern- ment fearful 'lest the University students in particular should imbibe dangerously progressive ideas', issued regulations for their control while inJapan. The students thereupon went on strike, announcing that unless the Japanese restrictions were removed they would either establish a University in Shanghai with European professors, or go to Europe or America to continue their studies. A correspondent writing to Hong Kong from Tokyo at the time asked, 'As these young men are the flowers of the intellect of China it has occurred to me that it would be a great diplomatic stroke to afford them facilities for study in a British community. Why cannot Hong Kong take the matter up?' {Item dated 9th December 1905 and reported in the China Mail on the 19th}"
2,8,7,"W. H. Donald, then managing director of the China Mail, took the matter up and set about drafting the editorial which has generally been taken to be the point at which the whole notion of a University of Hong Kong took origin. On the morning of the evening issue in which it was to appear he sent a copy of the proof to Government House, in an attempt to enlist the support of Sir Matthew Nathan in what he called his 'crusade' to establish in Hong Kong an imperial university. {15th December 1905} The article itself aroused a little desultory discussion in the corres- pondence column over a few days, notably a lengthy protest from Dr Bateson- Wright, the headmaster ofQueen's College, but no warmth from official quarters: though Nathan did fly a small kite, in a suggestion made at a prize-giving that St Stephen's College might affiliate itself with an English university. The crusade was, for the time being, dropped."
2,8,8,"Donald, an Australian with a strong sense of Empire and nothing if not persistent, waited for the coming of a new governor before raising the issue again. Sir Frederick Lugard arrived on the 28th July 1907. He was nearing fifty and had a distinguished career behind him in West Africa, to be resumed after his brief stay in Hong Kong. One of Britain's most able colonial administrators, his theory of trusteeship in administration had profound effects on the administration of Britain's colonies generally. But in Hong Kong he found no parallels with Africa; his long-serving Colonial Secretary, Francis May, who enjoyed the respect of the community and had some command of the language, had capable control of the administration. Lugard's fear was lest, for the first time in his career, he might serve a term without making any significant addition to the welfare of the community he was serving. He had scarcely been in office two months when Donald saw his chance."
2,8,9,"In one of a series of articles on Hong Kong's education in the Federal Magazine E. A. Irving { In 1911 he was the University's first Registrar and, in 1921, father of the first woman student admitted to it.}, then Director of Education and on leave in England, drew attention to the numbers of school children in Canton and the surrounding areas who sought their secondary education in the Anglo-Chinese schools of Hong Kong, and offered the conclusion that for Mainland students the schools in Hong Kong were more popular than those in Canton. The reason he gave was that the sound knowledge of English imparted in the Hong Kong schools opened up the world to their pupils. Donald used these articles as a pretext for reviving his crusade. { China Mail, 3rd October 1907}"
2,8,10,"At the same time the Imperial Edicts issuing from Peking, which required the profoundest of changes in the whole educational structure of China, were taken up for important discussion by the Christian missions at a conference specially convened in Shanghai. One of the delegates was the Reverend Lord William Gascoyne-Cecil, influential son of a prime minister of Britain and later consecrated Bishop of Exeter, who will appear again from time to time in this account. The British missions formed a China Missions Emergency Committee with Cecil as a prominent member. They saw the issue in China as one of emergency for Christianity in the East. 'The Chinese Government needs thou- sands of teachers', they said, 'and they must be first-rate teachers. Japanese instructors are pressing in. Is the teaching to be based on Christian or agnostic foundations? This is one great question for the missionary societies'.{Letter to The Times, quoted in the China Mail, 28th November 1907} The duel was between Materialism as represented by the Japanese, and the Christian Gospel as represented by the missions, and Education was to be the weapon. The reaction of the Emergency Committee to the Imperial Edicts found a ready ear in the British universities, and a joint committee was formed of prominent Oxford and Cambridge teachers to investigate the possibility of establishing a British university on Chinese soil."
3,0,0,The University Idea
3,1,1,LUGARD TOOK UP Donald's challenge at a prize-giving in St Stephen's College on the 17th January 1908 :
3,2,1,"I think that Hongkong should be the Oxford and Cambridge of the Far East ... I believe myself in the awakening of China and in the oppor- tunities for reciprocal benefits which that awakening will give to us and I believe that we must either now take those opportunities or leave them to others to take. The Warden when distributing the prizes last year alluded to the liberality of the ideas which were evident in the Peking examinations that year. That showed that China wanted a new class of men and a new class of learning ... I hope that Hongkong and this College may become the embryo University of Western learning, not merely for our own Colony but for the great and friendly Empire which is on our frontier"
3,3,1,"He was to change his mind about Oxford and Cambridge as models, and about incorporating a secondary school as part ofa university institution. The idea, however, fired the imagination of a Parsee, the merchant and broker Hormusjee Nowrojee Mody, Sir Paul Chater's partner in a number of enterprises which included the great Praya Reclamation Scheme conceived in 1887. Mody had emigrated from Bombay to Hong Kong fifty years before, his early days spent as an auctioneer of opium, then a legally respectable activity. He lived a simple, hard-working life and was hospitable and generous to his friends. He and Chater were also partners of the Canadian merchant Alfred Herbert Rennie in a new venture in Junk Bay to mill flour, and they became fast friends. Their Chinese compradore was Wei Yuk, of whom more later. The opening of Rennie's mill, at which a 'Paul Chater Cake' and scones were concocted from new-milled flour and ceremoniously eaten, had been performed on the 22nd January the previous year by Francis May while acting as Governor; unknown to the rest of the party, Mody had been caught on a band lift and hauled to the top floor, later to be discovered in a state of nervous collapse. It is tempting to conjecture that the first anniversary of this accident gave cause to Mody to contemplate human frailty, and that Lugard's vision of a University coincided with Mody's realiza- tion that he was an old man. He would be 70 years old in Igog. In return for the financial rewards Hong Kong had brought him he would bequeath to it an institu- tion of major significance: a university would form a fitting and lasting memorial. Perhaps he hoped to have the foundation stone laid in the year of his seventieth birthday. Using Rennie as intermediary and within a few days of Lugard's speech, he had made a preliminary offer of HK$ I50,000 for the erection of the first buildings and the endowment of a University. Once he had made up his mind his principal object was to get swift action: and without doubt he had in his thoughts the fruitless attempts of his friend the Hon. E. R. Belilios to bestow buildings upon the College of Medicine in the 18gos. But there were some complicating considerations."
3,3,2,"The year before his own magnificent offer, the College of Medicine had received the gift of $50,000 from another local merchant, Ng Li-hing, to erect the new anatomy laboratories and other buildings, and was awaiting the right opportunity to start an appeal for endowment. By the time Mody's offer was made, the College had already taken crucial decisions on the site and a building plan and was about to start construction work. There arose in Lugard's mind the immediate question, if the College should be incorporated in his new University? This is an appropriate point to move back in time and review briefly the College's origins and progress."
3,4,1,"The curative and preventive benefits of Western medicine were brought to China chiefly through the Christian missions and by surgeons attached to ships and trading units of the East India Company. As early as 1805 one of the Company's medical officers had pioneered vaccination in Canton; among its surgeons travelling East in the Company's ships was William Jardine, later famous in the firm that now incorporates his name."
3,4,2,"The Chinese Maritime Customs posts needed doctors, and to serve them Sir Robert Hart recruited their early medical officers mostly from Scotland, among them young Patrick Manson, appointed from Aberdeen in 1866 to look after the Customs complement in Formosa. After five years Manson moved to Amoy to work in a mission hospital, and in the course of his work there started to train his own assistants, an experience he was to build upon after moving to Hong Kong in 1883 to open a new private practice."
3,4,3,"The need for a medical school in Hong Kong had been the subject of public speeches from its first years: Dr Hobson, opening the first of the mission hospitals in 1844 had made the suggestion. But further action awaited catalysts of a different sort."
3,4,4,"At a public ceremony in the City Hall in May 1886 the acting Governor presented certificates granted by a medical board to two Hong Kong students who had fulfilled their training in the David Manson Memorial Hospital at Takao in Formosa, and the China Mail {1st June 1886} reminded its readers that the Hong Kong Government could itself have taken the initiative to offer local training in medical science proposed a decade before in connection with the Civil Hospital, and that an offer of E. R. Belilios made in 1879, to establish two medical scholarships for Chinese youths, still stood. {A little later Belilios advocated the transformation of Queen's College, the Government secondary school, into a university affiliated to an existing university in Britain. The suggestion was repeated in 1906 by Governor Nathan but in relation to St Stephen's College.} Two days after this reminder the foundation stone of the new Alice Memorial Hospital was laid on a site in Hollywood Road on the corner of Aberdeen Street. The cost of the site was met by the London Missionary Society, already engaged in dispensary work in the area, and by public subscription. The building was to be erected by Dr Ho Kai, a physician and barrister trained in Britain, as a memorial to his English wife, Alice Walkden, who had died in 1884. Belilios donated $5,000 towards the cost of the site. Dr Ho Kai was a congenial and unendingly cheerful man; in a series of mischievous quotations published in the press said to be apt to certain local worthies, Dr Ho Kai's was from Bret Harte: He smiled, as he sat by the table, A smile that was childlike and bland."
3,4,5,"He was reported to have been the first Chinese ever to sport Western dress. Manson became his firm friend and offered his professional services in an honorary capacity to the new hospital, together with a group of doctors who included Chater's nephew, G. P. Jordan, Francis Clark, and shortly also James Cantlie. Ho Kai, Jordan, and Clark were freemasons, and the masonic lodges were among its main benefactors."
3,4,6,"One of Ho Kai's principal objects was that his hospital should be used not only for the direct benefit of the poorer classes, but to advance the cause of medical science among the Chinese. At the foundation-stone laying on the srd June 1886 the hope was publicly expressed that italso marked the beginning of a medical school 'similar to the one established at Takao in Formosa', where students might be trained who in the course of time 'would carry the benefits of medical skill and knowledge into the heart of China'. The Hospital was open to patients the next February. Manson had soon found himself in need of help in his private practice and in 1885 invited Dr James Cantlie, an Aberdeen graduate like Ho Kai and himself, to join him in Hong Kong."
3,4,7,"Cantlie was attracted not only by the prospect of working in the Far East, but by the possibilities that were clearly opening in Hong Kong of training young Chinese in the practice of medicine. He was himself teaching in a medical school, enjoyed teaching, and had no wish to abandon it. It seems likely that he had delayed his final decision to accept Manson's offer until he was told of the new training expectation presented by the founders of the Alice Memorial Hospital. 'I conceived the idea of establishing a college of the kind on my way out to China', Cantlie said later, 'and from the time I landed there in June 1887 until October of that year I followed up the idea and found ready help from Dr (now Sir) Patrick Manson ...'.{Cantlie and Jones, Sun rat Sen and the awakening of China, 1912.} The voyage out was tedious, and he had the leisure to work out a scheme of organization in some detail, and perhaps even the bones of an anatomy syllabus. For shortly after he arrived he was able to call a meeting in the Hospital to put his proposal for the formation of a training college. It was no doubt his 'persuasive and fluent eloquence', which Stewart Lockhart had reason to recall during a public farewell to Cantlie in the City Hall almost ten years later,{On 5th February 1896. At the same occasion Jonathan Francis also spoke: 'You are practically the founder of the College ... and I believe it was primarily your idea that an attempt should be made to train Chinese students here in Western medicine'} 'which has been not inaptly compared to a Highland spate carrying all before it', which carried the decision to proceed so that a College might be inaugurated at a public meeting called for the afternoon of the 1st October. This gave them no more than a month in which to complete Cantlie's preliminary work, and to find accommodation and volunteer premedical instructors for the first year of a five-year curriculum. The bond which kept the three main partici- pants in the scheme at work with this intensity was undoubtedly their mutual connection with the University ofAberdeen. Manson agreed to give the inaugural speech and be first Dean, Cantlie to be first Secretary and Treasurer, and Ho Kai to be first Rector's Assessor, a Scottish term for deputy chairman. It was also decided to invite the Hon. Frederick Stewart, the Colonial Secretary, to be the College's first Rector. This cannot have been a difficult choice to make, as Stewart was himself an Aberdeen graduate. One can hardly avoid concluding that the distribution of offices was, in the terms of surgery, something of a 'carve-up', though they all brought with them a keen sense of the devoted toil required."
3,4,8,"Under 'the leadership of Dr Manson and the high-pressure stimulus of Dr Cantlie', as the local press put it, the new College of Medicine was inaugurated in a packed City Hall on the due date, and a General Council, a Court, and a Senate formed. In one ofseveral speeches at this optimistic assembly, the College's new standing counsel, Jonathan Francis, Q.c., hoped"
3,4,9,"that this medical college may blossom and blossom soon into a university in which all the faculties will be represented-in which ... I hope, although pro- bably several may not agree with me, there will be a legal faculty and instruction given in law and jurisprudence, instruction which will probably be found as necessary and useful in China as it has been found elsewhere. I know that the Dean of the College does not agree with me, for when I expressed to him this hope the other day his pious ejaculation was 'God forbid!', and the only suggestion which our Treasurer could make was that we should all be put into a junk and towed out to sea and got rid of that way."
3,5,1,"The first enrolment a few days later was large enough: twelve of the students enrolling, who included the revolutionary nucleus of the 'Four Great Outlaws', sat the first examination in 1888. From then many fell by the wayside, so that when the first five years was completed only two were left to graduate, one of them Sun Yat-sen, who had divided his time between his medical studies, discussing with his fellow students the republican philosophy that was to enshrine his ideas of reform in China, and inspiring a small band of young men in Hong Kong who would create one of his oversea bases of revolutionary support. Manson had sailed from Hong Kong in 1889 to achieve fame in London as 'the father of tropical medicine' and was succeeded in Hong Kong as second Dean by Candie. Francis Clark, trained not in Aberdeen but Durham and Cambridge, succeeded Candie as second Secretary and then in 1897 as third Dean, remaining in that office until the College's commitments had been wholly discharged, thus also becoming the first Dean of the University's Faculty of Medicine and holding the two deanships concurrently from 1912 to 1915. Among Manson's last tasks before leaving was to arrange for a more formal connection with officialdom in China, in causing the election of one of his patients, Li Hung-chang, to be the College's first Patron, then in Tientsin as Viceroy ofChihli. Viceroy Li, who remained Patron until his death in 1901, had been 'Chinese' Gordon's collaborator in the suppression of the Taipings, was close to the Throne and a friend of Britain, and had those qualities which caused Candie to refer to him as 'the Bismarck of China'. When Dr Sun Yat-sen abandoned his declining medical practice in 1894 to devote his whole energy to the cause of reform, it was to Viceroy Li he first turned, to his College Patron, to China's most influential exponent of westernization, journeying to Tientsin to deliver personally to him a letter in which he detailed his proposals for the country's reform."
3,6,1,"The College needed accommodation other than that assigned to it in the Alice Memorial Hospital, and money for its activities. The Hon. E. R. Be1ilios, who had been made a member of the College Court in 1890, the next year offered to erect buildings if the Government would provide a rent-free site, or alter- natively to give buildings in Saiyingpoon which belonged to him if the Govern- ment would give an endowment of $30,000 for a tutor. After five years of inconclusive negotiation in which the Government expressed its unwillingness to meet either condition, Belilios withdrew his offer. The Government expressed no financial interest in the College's needs until 1902, even in spite of the valuable services its students and graduates gave in the plague and small-pox epidemics of 18g8; and even when the estimates provided for the sum of $2,500 a year for the payment of honoraria to the College teachers, it was apparently on the understanding that thereafter the graduates would bind themselves to the service of the Government for three years."
3,6,2,"In the Nethersole Hospital, opened in September 1893, the College found one new source of space; in June 1904 another, when the Alice Maternity Hospital was added; and again in July 1906, with the founding by Mrs Wu Ting-fang of the Ho Miu Ling Hospital. But lacking in the whole period were proper facilities for the teaching of anatomy, for which permission had been granted in 1888 'to hold post-mortem examinations on unclaimed bodies removed from the Alice Memorial Hospital'; and there were few student amenities, and little room for the increasing needs of administration. The students were often accommodated inside the hospitals themselves. Dr Li Shu-fan recalls that when he entered the College in 1903 he shared a room with Wang Chung-yik, who later became the University's first professor of pathology, and relates that from their window they could see across the road 'an undertaker's establishment named ""Fook Sau"", meaning ""Blessing and Longevity""! Whenever an ambulance arrived at the hospital, someone from Fook Sau would quietly check on the condition of the patient. If death were impending, or if the patient died later, a representative of the funeral parlour would call on the family at once'-if there was no family, the body was available for dissection. A report to the Governor made in 1906 shows that in 1903, when Li entered the College, dumped bodies accounted for 32.7% of the mortality in Hong Kong. There was no problem about corpses for anatomical dissection."
3,6,3,"A committee formed in London by Cantlie, who had been permitted to retain the title of Dean for a further year after he had returned in 18g6, produced no response to an appeal for funds with which to build College accommodation. Finally, in Ig05 the Government reserved two sites in Taipingshan for College buildings, with the assurance that if within five years the College had raised the sum required for new buildings the sites would be granted free. Death having overtaken him in London, Belilios was no longer in the arena. Ho Kai began the round of his other friends, and the Court prepared to launch a public appeal for endowment funds. In August the Court heard that Tang Chuk-kai, dying that month, had bequeathed the sum of $ I0,000 to the College. In order to be legally competent to receive bequests it now became imperative that the College should be incorporated."
3,6,4,"Its Rector, Francis May, was acting as Governor when the bill of incorpora- tion was read in Legislative Council. Ho Kai moved the readings during one week, and announced that he would shortly be in a position to get the buildings started. His motion was seconded by Wei Yuk, who later himself became associated with the University project. The opportunity was taken to remove the words 'for the Chinese' from the title the College had borne from its inauguration, since several of the students were not Chinese. May advanced his opinion that there was perhaps no more useful institution in the Colony than the Hong Kong College of Medicine. The incorporation became effective on the 23rd May 1907."
3,6,5,"At the Court meeting held the next month Ho Kai revealed that his friend Ng Li-hing had offered to erect the two buildings at the estimated total cost of $50,000, his intention being to hand over $20,000 'in the course of the 34th year ofKwang Sui (1908-9)' and the balance over six years. Lugard had been invited to be Patron as soon as he arrived in Hong Kong and accepted. The Government was preparing the free grant of land on condition that Ng Li-hing's $20,000 was spent on buildings before the end of March 1909. Sir Paul Chater, broker and property-owner and uncle of Dr G. P. Jordan, was a member of the committee preparing to raise an endowment. Ho Kai first consulted him in the matter of the appeal, and Chater counselled delay because of the current trade depression, but promised his personal assistance when business improved. It was at this point, when a contract was about to be signed for the construction of the anatomy laboratory and museum, that Lugard's speech at St Stephen's College drew the new offer of buildings, now for a University of Hong Kong, from Chater's partner, Mody. {George Endacott, historian of Hong Kong, contributed a chapter on the University's beginnings to The First 50 rears, 1962, which I have drawn upon for some of this account}"
3,7,1,"Lugard promptly put the circumstance through Rennie to Mody. Mody's response was that if he was 'allowed to erect the C. of M. and the U. alone' whatever money was left could be used for endowment, and he foresaw no hitch. Lugard had spoken in confidence to May as Rector and the College Court agreed to co-operate, but proposed to proceed with its own building programme and suggesting that an adjoining site should be reserved for the accommodation of 'Divinity, Law, Engineering, and Science'. Mody refused to approve of the site-plan at Taipingshan, however, which Lugard also agreed was 'too shut in and on different levels', and Mody went on to ask, 'I saw in yesterday's paper {China Mail, 18th February 1908, first editorial. This gave the Editor, Donald, another open- ing for a salvo in his crusade-the Mody gift had not yet, of course, been made public} that the Germans are thinking of teaching their language in a University in Kiouchou, why cannot we get ahead of them that the Germans are thinking of teaching their language in a University in Kiouchou, why cannot we get ahead of them'."
3,7,2,"A proposal to establish a University at Kiouchou brought before the Reichstag on the 18th February was turned down, since there was no prospect of its paying immediate dividends, much the same objection as that voiced in 1905 by Dr Bateson-Wright. But Mody's desire for swift action was dictated not so much by competition of this sort, as by a feeling that his own life was running out of time: he was unwell as well as ageing, anxious to proceed with the greatest possible haste, and wondering if perhaps he should seek about for some other investment for his cash. Within the week an alternative site at the junction of Bonham and Pokfulam Roads was proposed by Lugard and approved by Mody: the site where the Main Building now stands."
3,7,3,"On the 3rd March at a general meeting of the College held in the Alice Memorial Hospital, with Ho Kai present and the officers and staff and students, no doubt among them Li Shu-fan and C. Y. Wang, the decision was finally taken to amalgamate the College with the University on the site now proposed. Mody then said that if the land were handed over to him within the month he would see to it that the buildings were erected within the following twenty, which would bring him to his seventieth year. The College suspended the construction of the anatomical laboratories due to start the following week, giving Lugard and Mody one week in which to concur in certain conditions, one of which was that an adequate endowment should be raised before the University building started."
3,7,4,"Lugard then took time to consider his own position as intermediary in the negotiations between the College and Rennie acting on Mody's instructions, and came to the conclusion that in a situation in which swift agreements were needed it was 'unsatisfactory, dilatory, and unbusinesslike', and called a meeting on the 13th March at which all interested sides were represented, Rennie still acting on behalf of Mody and Ho Kai for his friend Ng Li-hing. The site and a general scheme for buildings were settled, in which the anatomical laboratories were to be built at the west end with Ng's donation, and Faculties of Law and Engineer- ing and the premedical sciences were to be accommodated in Mody's building; the College would become a Faculty of Medicine in the new University; and all appeals for endowment would be diverted for the purposes of the University, except that the residue of Ng's donation and Tang's bequest were to be set aside for the College's use until it had fulfilled all its obligations. Lugard undertook to appoint and preside over a new general Committee charged with the organizing of a University, and called its first meeting five days later."
3,7,5,"There are, about this Committee and its work, three faint oddities. One is that it was destined to be constantly confronted with the month of March as a kind of annual chapter-heading. Conceived and fi""rst convened itself in March (1908), it gave birth to an endowment-fund-raising sub-committee which became effective in March (1909), and to a Committee of Management which achieved the laying of the first foundation stone in March (1910), the drafts of an Ordin- ance which became law in March (1911), and plans for a first building which was opened in March (1912). An interesting topic for investigation, perhaps, this bunching effect before the torrid months of long, hot summers; though it may have been caused simply by the tidy workings of the balance-sheet mind and its constant year-end habits. Another oddity is that its members included three nascent Chancellors, being Lugard himself, and May and Clementi."
3,7,6,The third is the shadowy sense of deja vu which the reading of the list of its members kindles in the mind of a present-day resident of Hong Kong. It is so strangely like a set of extracts taken at random from a modern local topographical gazetteer.
3,7,7,"Mody has left his name, of course, on Mody Road in the midst ofKowloon's trading centre. Of the other four whose energies were in greatest demand in the enterprise the names are permanent accompaniments of daily life. There is the Sunday paradise for walkers with long sight-Lugard Road running round the Peak on perilous piles, at every yard a breath-taking view. One of the world's major airports is Kaitak, set on the Kaitak reclamation of Kowloon Bay, a fusion of the given names of Ho Kai and his partner in the reclamation project, Au Tak. In the island's mid-levels, May Road carries the quieter dwelling development. The broad, busy route from the centre of the City of Victoria which marks the inland boundary of the Praya Reclamation Scheme is Chater Road."
3,7,8,"With the goings and comings endemic to Hong Kong, the members of the Committee changed a little during its sessions. The full list comprises twenty-five names, of which there is no need here to take great account, except that among them there were only nine, including that ofWei Yuk, that are not now remem- bered in some topographical corner or another. We know Chatham Road and Path, we can visit Chatham Court. A township which has taken shape along Junk Bay has arisen as Rennie's Mill: Rennie himself, in the midst of the Lugard-Mody negotiations, died tragically at his own hand by drowning in Junk Bay when his flour mill there failed. There are Pollock's Corner and Cecil's Walk and Lady Clementi's Ride, which perhaps reflect some sort of habitual arrangement of the time. There are Stewart and Thomson Roads, and Catchik, Gresson, Irving, and Keswick Streets. There are both Clementi Road and Sir Cecil Clementi Road, and of course Clementi Middle School (but not in between). There are the Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital, Kaitak Road, Kaitak Amusement Park, and Brewin Path."
3,7,9,"The first sub-committee appointed by this General Committee to report on the project pronounced it impracticable. Mody's gift was inadequate for the initial buildings required; the minimum running cost, including teachers for medicine and engineering, would be over ?6,000 a year."
3,7,10,"Mody then offered $30,000 to the endowment in addition to his gift of the buildings, provided that Ng Li-hing would match it; later approving that the sum could be added to the sum required for the building itself. Lugard attempted a compromise solution, the Committee accepting it, that the buildings should be put up and the College of Medicine and the Technical Institute accommodated in them while an endowment was being sought. The Technical Institute, with which the local branch of the Royal Sanitary Institute was incorporated, was an evening institute with a staff of part-time teachers and an income accruing from the Li Shing Trust, fees, and a deficit balance from the Government. May demurred, repeating the College's early view that buildings should not be constructed before an adequate endowment was raised, lest once a building was erected and the College and Institute installed in it, the whole project might simply die. But the General Committee had a long-term eye on the major object, which was to afford 'a higher education, more especially in subjects of practical utility such as Applied Science, Medicine, etc., on the lines of such universities as Leeds and Birmingham', and to confer degrees 'of a standard not inferior to those conferred by such universities', and persuaded the College to concur that the scheme should nevertheless go ahead. Then Mody himself demurred, and with some impatience. What he wanted to see established and working in his lifetime was a University, not a home for a College and an Institute. Pressing for a public endowment drive 'not only at home but throughout the Chinese Empire' he extended his offer so that building might start by mid-1909, and increased it to whatever sum might be needed to provide a building as designed by Alfred Bryer his architect. Later still, he undertook to layout the grounds and build not only the Main Building but houses for the Principal and Professors and a Gate Lodge, on new designs estimated to cost $285,000, in effect almost doubling his original offer."
3,8,1,"InJanuary Igog Lugard prepared for use as an appeal document a memo- randum in which he set out the considerations which had developed in discussion of the project and the sort of University he expected it to be, and had it translated also into Chinese. In it he said he would appoint a Committee of Management to stay in session until a University was in being. This Committee comprised twelve members with himself in the chair, being the Anglican Bishop and the five senior Government administrative officers ex officio, among whom were May, still Rector of the College, Sir Paul Chater, Mody, Ho Kai, Wei Yuk, Lau Chu-pak, {Mr Lau was prominent among Hong Kong citizens taking a personal interest in the founding of the University, and was a founder-member of its Court and Council. His descendents have directed the Hong Kong and Yaumati Ferry Company founded by his son Tak-po}  and Cecil Clementi. Ho Kai and Wei Yuk together listed about a hundred members for a fund-raising sub-committee, and they were called together to hear an account of the scheme delivered by Lugard. Over the following months Lugard agreed to additions to the membership. With Ho Kai in the chair and Ts'o Seen-wan as principal secretary the sub-committee held weekly Sunday meetings in the Tung Wah Hospital, and formed groups among friends in Chinese cities and Chinese communities overseas, most prominent among the discussants being Ho Fook, who took an intense interest in the project. Lugard himself undertook to enlist the aid variously of Sir John Jordan, the ambassador in Peking, in seeking a contribution from the Imperial Government, the Shanghai Municipal Council whose Chairman was then David Landale, the Viceroy of the Two K wang Provinces in Canton, the Viceroy of India, a large number of Governors and other officials in Britain and South Asia and elsewhere, and the British firms."
3,8,2,"He asked J. H. Scott of John Swire and Sons in London, at the time President of the China Association, to form a home committee to solicit funds; but Scott preferred his own methods and within a fortnight of receiving Lugard's memorandum had contrived to collect promises from his own and associated companies amounting to the princely sum of ?40,000. 'The initiative of Mr J. H. Scott', wrote Lugard, 'entitles him to be considered as joint founder of the University with Mr Mody'. Swire ships had recently been the object of an almost ruinous boycott inspired by a 'self-government association' at Canton in retalia- tion for an incident in which their ticket-collector was said to have kicked to death an elderly Chinese passenger during a trip to Canton from Hong Kong. The Swire donation to the endowment fund was timely, and featured in a certificate of exculpation issued in June by Chang J en-chun, Viceroy of Canton, with an order that trading should be resumed. But to the Viceroys's embarrass- ment the boycott was not lifted until Swires had suffered some positive humilia- tion. The China Association made the University project the central feature at its annual meeting, and published a pledge of full support for the large project, in a letter which had been sent to it by the committee Cantlie formed in 1907 to collect funds for the College of Medicine."
3,8,3,"The Viceroy of Canton undertook to raise $200,000: but first expressed some misgivings on the propriety ofinc1uding in Lugard's fund-raising committee the names of certain men 'who had the reputation of being active participants in the revolutionary propaganda led by Dr Sun Yat-sen'. The men were Chan Siu-pak and Dr Kwan Sum-yin, alias Kwan King-Ieung. Of both we have heard before in this narrative in connection with the 'Four Great Outlaws' of Dr Sun's College days. Chan was one of the additional secretaries assisting Ts'o Seen-wan in the fund-raising group. Colonial Secretary May knew him well. In a minute to Lugard in the Government House files, he described him as 'an editor of a Chinese newspaper that has at times been troublesome owing to its attacks on the Provincial Government and Chinese officials generally. The man dresses in European style and is undoubtedly of the ""Reform"" Party. But he is not a revolutionary and not dangerous. He has not made himself conspicuous of late. There is a law to restrain him. Ifhe were really dangerous like Dr Sun he would have been banished long ago'. He had been one of the committee which had received the Duke of Connaught; and was often used as a translator of public documents, especially in the medical field. Asked his view, Ho Kai confessed that 'H.E.'s memo was also translated by him, as were the subscription regulations and the 2 minutes of the General Committee. He has drafted many of our letters'. Ho Kai had also been friendly with Dr Kwan for twenty years but had had no suspicion of any revolutionary tendencies. E.A. Irving, then Registrar- General, commented: 'There were one or two names on the list which might be objected to by the Viceroy on the same grounds: but as regards these, perhaps it will be better to let sleeping dogs lie'-one of the sleeping dogs being Li Yuk-tong, proprietor of the Kum Lee drugstore in Bonham Strand East, which had for some time been a local headquarters of the T'ung-meng-hui and an assembly point for local sympathizers with the revolutionaries. It was he who collected the funds sent by oversea Chinese to assist Dr Sun's efforts to overthrow the Manchu Dynasty. He was also, perhaps for his known international experience in such matters, one of the thirty members specially appointed to Ho Kai's collecting committee for the University's endowment, and later became the first finance minister under the new republic established by Dr Sun. His drugstore contributed to the endowment fund. Lugard sent for Chan Siu-pak, who 'personally assured me that for the last three years or more he has not propagated any views regarding the Government of China through the public press or by any other means, and has entirely devoted his time to farming and to assisting the Government and others in translating work'."
3,8,4,"Mollified by the reply sent to him, the Viceroy issued a manifesto to his officials to meet him and settle the manner of complying with Lugard's request for money. By June he had succeeded in raising the promised $200,000; and this encouraged Mody to extend his deadline by a further six months to the end of the year."
3,9,1,"The Reverend Lord William Cecil visited China again early in 1909, but this time for a different purpose. His visit was the culmination of an investigation into China's higher educational needs undertaken by the Oxford and Cambridge joint committee, all devout Christians and generally orientated in their investiga- tions by Lord William himself, and assisted by Sir Ernest Satow, Sir John Jordan's predecessor as ambassador at Peking. A nevv report from Shanghai set out the conclusions they had reached so far:"
3,10,1,"China's awakening to Western ideas, says Lord William Cecil, drew attention to two important features ofthe present situation: the immense and growing demand for advanced University education; and the fact that in Japanese and Chinese Universities, so-called, Western education has a strongly materialistic bias which tends to sweep away old religious beliefs, and with them all old sanctions of morality, without replacing them by any other code of ethics. In the University of Tokyo there are some 7,000 Chinese students, and 'Western' schools and universities, the efficiency of which leaves much to be desired, are being founded all over China. China's ruling class being an aristocracy of education not of birth, the future of the nation depends upon her Universities to an extent unknown elsewhere. The Committee referred to above, after careful deliberation, arrived at the conclusion that China's greatest need at the present day is a really efficient University, which would set a high standard of educational efficiency and moral tone, and at the same time might be regarded as a model for native Universities. It is suggested that this University should be organized upon similar lines to Oxford and Cambridge, and should consist of a central body of professors and a number of colleges and hostels each supported by missionary bodies of various denominations in which the students would be under some kind of moral discipline. In these hostels or colleges, religious instruction on the lines approved by the society or denomination that supported them, would be given. It is hoped that by this means many of the existing Christian colleges might be federated into the central University. It is suggested that the professors and teachers of the University should not be required to subscribe to any definite formulas of Christian belief: on the other hand they will be required to be men of strong Christian principles, and in keen sympathy with missionary ideals.... It is anticipated that ? I0,000 would give the University a fair start in the way of buildings and plant, and, allowing for unforeseen expenses, it has been estimated that the original capital outlay on the University should not exceed ?50,000, while an annual income of ?50,000 would probably suffice when once the University has started."
3,11,1,"The siting of this University was to await the outcome of Lord Cecil's visit, which embraced Hankow, Nanking, Peking, Tientsin, Shanghai, and as far as I-chang up the Yangtze River; while his purpose drew warm official sympathy and hearty approval, there was not much favour shown to any site within reason- able distance of the seat of Government."
3,11,2,"To May on the 8th January Lugard minuted, 'Lord W. Cecil I understand will be here in a month and I hope to induce him to amalgamate his project with ours'. If there was money to be had for Cecil's scheme, then there was presumably money which could be used for the Hong Kong scheme instead. But Lord William omitted Hong Kong wholly from his itinerary. He was not interested in amalgamation. For one reason, he wished to be in an area where the official northern language was spoken, and Hong Kong was Cantonese-speaking; for another, China was vast and could take more than one such scheme. Certainly his purposes were different-he was intent on Christianizing China, not educat- ing it in the 'new materialism' brought by Western technology!, and was encouraged by an experimental attempt then being made to provide an inter- denominational institution in Chengtu, where a West China Union University was being formed. 'The University of Hong Kong will be very beneficial to the colony', he admitted, 'but as a means of naturalizing the higher side of our civilization it labours under the great disadvantage of not being either in China nor under the Chinese flag, nor of speaking the prevailing language', none of which were disadvantages in Lugard's own view at all. And in Cecil's scheme, which was known as the United Universities Scheme, the language of instruction was to be Chinese; in Lugard's it was essential that it should be English."
3,11,3,"Lugard continued to try and win Cecil over, and published for private circulation a pamphlet setting out all the points in Cecil's scheme against the points in his own, with his comments on the differences and similarities. Sending a copy to Cecil on the 26th May, he stressed his own deep conviction of the need for moral discipline, and pointed out that he would be encouraging religious missions to open hostels for University students: though he did not confine this to the Christian missions. He was by then, too, able to produce an impressive array of promises of money already made: ?40,000 from the Swire Group, Mody's building fund, Ng Li-hing's transferred funds, as well as a site in the process of being granted and more money still expected."
3,11,4,"Lord William's reply was to the effect that 'a University in Hong Kong can never satisfy the national aspirations of the Chinese' because of the language of instruction; and he insisted that since 'science will sweep away the old religious beliefs of China, it is dangerous to leave no other ideal interests to take their place.{Letter to Lugard of 8th July 1909.}  Sir Robert Hart's view, though he was a strong backer of the United Universities Scheme, was that the Hong Kong scheme was more 'practically promising'. And so it was, as Cecil's lacked financial backing and came to nothing."
3,12,1,"Under official pressure the number of Chinese students in Japan was falling rapidly by this time, until by 1912 when the University was opened there were no more than 3,000 still under instruction there."
3,12,2,"The Imperial Government set about finding oversea placings for its students elsewhere, and despatched His Excellency T'ang Shao-yi on a round of visits to Europe and America, partly in an attempt to divert the Boxer Indemnities for the purpose of educating Chinese students in the West. T'ang himself was a Cantonese, educated in Hong Kong in the Morrison School moved over from Malacca in 1870. Together with Chow (later Sir) Shou-son, he had been in the third of the contingents sent by the Chinese Government to the United States in an early oversea experiment, to continue their studies at Columbia and New York Universities, but recalled in 1881 when it was reported they were becoming denationalized. While on his mission T'ang contrived to persuade the American government to permit the residue of its portion of the Indemnities to be used to send one hundred students to America that year and fifty a year thereafter for periods of four years during the whole of the repayment period."
3,12,3,"On his way back to Peking, T'ang spent the night in Hong Kong and was told by Lau Chii-pak, who welcomed him, of the magnificent sum raised by the Viceroy of Canton for the University project, and before leaving for Shanghai on the German mailboat, he himself made a gift of $1,000 to the endowment fund.{China Mail, 18th June 1909.}"
3,12,4,"Viceroy Chang had become enthusiastic in his support of Lugard's project and was curious to see Mody and talk about it. At the end ofJuly he was passing through Hong Kong on his way to become Viceroy of the Two Kiangs at Nanking and asked especially to meet him. Mody was prevented by sickness from attending an official lunch at Government House, but a meeting was arranged for the next morning at Chater's house, with Ho Kai and Mody in the party to meet Viceroy Chang. In the course of this meeting, the Viceroy made it clear that the money he had raised would be supplemented with other individual donations from residents of Canton, and that once he was settled in Nanking he would continue his efforts among the residents there."
3,12,5,"Among the fund-raising activities promoted by the local Committee of Thirty that year were two Chinese theatrical performances at the Ko Shing Theatre. The first drew a handsome profit of $5,000. The second was to have been held on the 8th September, when it was expected that the Emperor's uncle Prince Hsiin would attend, as he was passing through Hong Kong on his way to Canton with Admiral Sa Chen-ping and a large entourage of officials during a tour of inspection of China's naval installatons. But since he was still in mourn- ing for the deaths of his brother the Emperor K wang Hsii and the Dowager Tsu Hsi, the performance was postponed and replaced by a dinner at the theatre, where he was received by Lau Chii-pak. The Prince returned from Canton on the loth on his way to study naval organization in Europe as part of the imperial modernization programme; but it seems unlikely that the performance was held then either. There was a second performance, however, which was dedicated to the Prince and fetched into the endowment fund a little over $ 1 ,000. A letter to Lugard later in the year {28 November 1909, quoted in the Souvenir published in connection with the foundation- stone: laying ceremony} from Sir Chentung Liang Cheng, then in London and accompanying Prince Hsiin on a three-week tour of naval dockyards and ship- yards in Britain, expressed the Prince's support for the University project: he had met Lord Crewe, who was at the time Secretary of State, and 'gave his hearty approval of the establishing of the Hongkong College. His Imperial Highness said to his Lordship that education, besides what actually benefits the individual, is the missionary of trade and promoter of friendly feelings, and with such a College as Your Excellency has in view the poorer classes of the teeming millions of China's population will be much facilitated in their road to acquire a useful modern education'. It was this 'poorer classes' concept which was to lead the University into some financial trouble for some years after its founding."
3,12,6,"By the 13th December it was possible for Lugard to accept Mody's gift to Hong Kong with all conditions fulfilled. At the end of the year the endowment and equipment fund had reached over one-and-a-quarter million dollars, collected by Lugard's Chinese Sub-Committee, and he could move into the next immediate stages: the laying of a foundation stone and the drafting of an ordinance of incorporation in a form which might later, it was hoped, be exchanged for a Royal Charter."
3,13,1,"The foundation stone of the Main Building was laid on the 16th March 1910 by Lugard at Mody's invitation. Lady Lugard was not present. After the band of the 13th Rajputs had opened with the national anthem, from his seat next to Sir Paul Chater rose Mody, a frail and ageing man who started the ceremony with a speech in which he explained his motives in participating in the project, arising in 'the idea of in some measure providing for others what I was myself denied', in the words of Edmund Blunden mildly retaliating on destiny. His heartfelt wish that the Almighty might 'permit me to see the building duly completed and successfully started on its useful work' was not to be granted, as he died before it was opened. Not long after the foundation-stone ceremony Lugard accompanied Mody to the site to view progress, and at the opening ceremony recalled 'his spare figure sitting on the site amid a wilderness of bricks and a chaos of rocks and debris ... and saying that ""all must be of the very best"" in every detail of construction, regardless of cost'. Mody died while the building was in the middle of construction and lived only to hear of the University's incorporation under local Ordinance. He is buried in the Parsee Cemetery at Happy Valley."
3,13,2,"The foundation stone of the Main Building was laid on the 16th March 1910 by Lugard at Mody's invitation. Lady Lugard was not present.

Mody died while the building was in the middle of construction and lived only to hear of the University's incorporation under local Ordinance. He is buried in the Parsee Cemetery at Happy Valley."
3,13,3,"For Lugard the laying of the foundation stone was one of his life's great moments. It symbolized for him a watershed in British colonial history. In a reference to his previous African days, 'It has happened to me in past years that I have been the humble instrument by which the confines of the Empire were enlarged in some directions. Those days', he claimed, 'are past. It is no longer an age of acquisition in which we live, but an age of development', a prescription which was to guide the style of his further administration in Nigeria after he had left Hong Kong two years later. 'It is my belief,' he went on to say, 'that the graduates of this University, its doctors of medicine, its scientific engineers, and its trained administrators, will exert an influence which will be immeasurable in the future, among the 400 millions of China's population.' He then told the gathering that His Majesty the King had appointed Mody to a knighthood and he had been instructed to delay the announcement until the ceremony itself. At the end of his speech he thanked Sir Hormusjee Mody 'for the beautiful trowel you propose to present to me'. The trowel was, as we see in the picture of Mody delivering his speech (in volume two), in a long flat box on a table in front of Lugard. Opening it, he took out a large, glittering, golden tool of such flaccid delicacy that he was impelled to ask the architect's help in deploying mortar from his mortarboard under what was, as can be seen, a very cumbersome stone. This task finished and the golden trowel wiped clean of clinging mortar and replaced, slightly bent, in its casket, a Delegate who had been bidden to attend the ceremony by the two Viceroys of the Two K wang and Two Kiang Provinces delivered their twin message of cordial goodwill. 'I am charged', said His Excellency, 'by their Excellencies the Viceroys to extend to the workers who have brought into the sphere of practical politics a University for Hong Kong and South China, the genuine appreciation and co-operation of the people of the Two Kwang Provinces ... Geographically, Hong Kong is a portion of China, and what makes for the good of one part must naturally reflect profitably upon the whole country,' an observation which has stood the test of more than two generations in time, and a revolution and two wars. Before Sir Hormusjee delivered the words with which his ceremony closed, Ho Kai handed to the Double Delegate twin cases containing two silver trowels to be presented to the two Viceroys of the Two K wangs and the Two Kiangs. All three trowels bore an inscription identical with that on the foundation stone. The silver trowels were taken off to be presented to the Viceroys in Canton and Nanking; and when he left Hong Kong Lugard took his with him to England. It is now in the U niver- sity's possession."
