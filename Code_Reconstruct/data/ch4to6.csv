4,0,0,University in Embryo
4,1,1,"AT THE SECOND MEETING of his General Committee held in October 1908Lugard had developed at some length the considerations that moved him in his anxiety to see a University established in Hong Kong, and his ideas of what sort of University it should be. Over the two years in which the work of founding it progressed, he sought every opportunity to repeat them, modified in small particulars from time to time, in the form of appeals, despatches, letters, and memoranda to officials and organizations in Hong Kong, China, the East generally, and Britain, in fact wherever interest might be aroused in helping him with advice and money."
4,1,2,"In the preceding pages I have shown the forces at work around him and his Committee and whence the forces derived their strength. Here, I sum up thecways in which China itself sought to use the education the West had to offer, and in which the West sought to oblige."
4,1,3,"China's own attempts to bring Western ideas to its intellectuals were half-hearted and infused with suspicion of Western motives. The Western educational institutions in China had almost all been established by the Christian missions; in their curriculum they walked the tightrope between traditional Chinese studies and the Western sciences; some of them were in the course of time to develop to a university level, but not until after the revolution. Lugard therefore saw his project as the first in the field."
4,1,4,"The training of officers for reorganized naval and land forces, the education of officials who might know how to deal effectively with foreigners in China's relations with the foreign powers, and the training of young men to teach the Western sciences and technology seemed to the Chinese best acquired abroad. But secondary education in China was of a low standard and deficient, and the early contingents of potential officials and scholars sent to the West, most of them to America, had to be sent when young and for extended periods-ten years seemed to be the minimum. Not only was it an expensive process, but the young intellectuals who were being groomed in this way for leadership became denationalized by it, and it put them out of touch and sympathy with the realities of the China they returned to. By 1881they were being recalled. The same experiment when transferred to Japanese schools and universItIes, but on a much larger scale, provided China with officers for the armed forces and teachers for the schools who were either debauched or, more frequently and far more seriously, committed to the reform of China by revolutionary means: and that in Japanese universities which had not yet attained the standards of their Western counterparts. Lugard was advised by the Japanese Government through the ambassador at Tokyo in 1908 that of the universities in Japan 'the standard is different to that of England or America and no comparison can well be made'."
4,1,5,"Proposals and rumoured proposals for the founding of foreign-staffed and foreign-funded universities in the foreign concessions on Chinese soil were widespread. There was a proposal for a German university to be set up at Kiauchou, though this in the event turned out to be a secondary-level college chiefly for instruction in the German language. There was a report that the Anglo-Chinese College at Amoy, where science and English were specialities, was to be raised in status. The educational reformer Dr Lim Boon-keng of Singapore had collected $1 00,000 to found a medical school at Amoy and Ho Kai, accompanied by Ts'o Seen-wan, met him in an attempt to divert the sum for the Hong Kong University project. An unfounded report found its way into the newspapers that the Russian Government intended to establish two univer- sities in Manchuria, one at Kirin and the other at Heilungkiang with accom- modation for 500 students, whose chief studies were to be Russian and the sciences. Canton Christian College was being loosely affiliated to an independent University Medical School at Canton supported by the UniversityofPennsylvania. The College of Yale in China founded in 1902 by a society of graduates and students of Yale University prepared its pupils up to senior high-school level for admission into universities in America, but did not grant degrees until 1919 under powers granted by the State of Connecticut. Tsinghua College, in 1911 becoming Tsinghua University, was founded in Peking for the same purpose out ofa remission by the United States ofpart ofits Boxer Indemnities, and comprised middle and high schools. These arrangements reduced the length of time the Chinese student was away from a Chinese environment. In 1909 Harvard University endorsed the founding of a medical school in Peking to be staffed by Harvard men, but the endorsement was no more than moral though a mission was sent to China to investigate. A West China Union University was formed from a group of American missionary secondary schools in 1910, a university more in prophecy than in fact, with the prime aim of training Chinese and foreign missionaries for the Christian missions in China."
4,1,6,"At Taiyuanfu a Chinese Government institution specializing in engineering called the Imperial Shansi University was established in memory of German missionaries murdered by the Boxers, under joint Chinese and British direction until 1911 when it was transferred to the provincial authority. Its medium of instruction was English, as it was also in the Tangshan Engineering College, in Peiyang University outside Tientsin, and in the North China Medical College for Women founded in 1912. But any really effective increase in the Chinese Government's participation in university-level education awaited the 1920S, when for the prevailing Japanese patterns were substituted the American."
4,1,7,"Something has been said (pages 28-30) of Cecil's Oxford and Cambridge scheme for a university in China teaching the humanities in the Chinese language. Other than Lugard's it was the only British project, and for that reason he saw it as being in competition with his, even though it seems not to have been designed with any of the considerations Lugard himself had in mind, nor to meet any of the real needs expressed by the Chinese themselves."
4,1,8,"In the academic year 1909-10 there were about 400 students from China in America and Britain together and still, despite official discouragement, 5,000 left in Japan. By 1912 the number in Japan had fallen to below 3,000; in American universities it had increased to 717 including 274 on Boxer scholar- ships; and in Britain where there were no Boxer scholarships there were 140 Chinese Government scholars."
4,1,9,"All these events and reports served each to reinforce Lugard's resolve, and added independent strength to his arguments."
4,2,1,"The new University of Hong Kong was not constitutionally modelled on Oxford and Cambridge but on the new civic universities in Leeds, Liverpool, and Birmingham. Its language of instruction was to be English, as the most appropriate vehicle for the importation of Western technology and ideals. The burden of financing it, Hong Kong could not be expected to bear in its entirety since its aims were of British scale-it would therefore have to be largely self- supporting. A Chinese student in Europe or in America expected his education to cost his family or his government about £200 a year as well as travel. In Hong Kong he would achieve the same object at less than a quarter of this (£43/15/1)."
4,2,2,"The new University would have no concern with the spread of Christianity, but would be secular. Moral instruction would be the concern of residential hostels, which any religious body might open, Christian or otherwise. The problem of character training and of moral discipline and the installing of high ideals in the students was one which exercised the thoughts of the University's founders from the moment Cecil's scheme had appeared in the arena. Lugard considered it at such length and to such purpose that he embodied his arguments and conclusions in a paper dated the 31st March 1911, which he proposed to send to the first Congress of Universities of the British Empire to be convened in London in the summer of 1912. In the event, the University having appointed him to be its delegate, he was the chief speaker at one of the Congress sessions held on the 3rd July with A. J. Balfour in the chair. It was at this meeting that the body now known as the Association of Commonwealth Universities was established, with the University of Hong Kong as a founder member. Lugard's paper bore the title 'The problem of universities in the East in regard to their influence on character and moral ideals', and in it he discussed the effects of the divorce of university education from religion, measuring the principles of broad tolerance laid down for the new University of Hong Kong against the actual experiences of the universities in India. The sum of the objects and the principles which would guide the new University Lugard wrote out in March 1910:"
4,3,1,"It is open to all races and creeds, and its matriculation and degree examinations will be maintained at a standard equal to that of English Universities. Its medium of instruction will be English, so that those who graduate may be able to read for themselves the works in English dealing with the subjects they take up, and British influence in the Far East may be extended. Chinese language and litera ture will also be taught to Chinese. Especial efforts will be made to train character, and to exert an effective moral discipline by compulsory residence either in approved colleges or hostels, or in the University itself, and by the careful selec- tion of the professorial staff. There will be no obligation of any kind whatsoever to adopt, or to receive instruction in, any particular form of religion, but the University will work in harmony with all religious bodies. Students may take up, or not take up, whatever subjects their parents or guardians please.... It will, as the Viceroy of Canton points out, promote a good understanding and friend- ship between British and Chinese. It will afford a cheaper means of acquiring higher Western education for Chinese, without exile to the West for a long period, involving denationalization and disunion from their parents and people."
4,4,1,"It would be in effect a British University on Chinese soil. It would make special efforts to attract students from China, those who otherwise would have had to go to America or Britain for a university education; and it would be an outlet also for Chinese and other students in other territories in South Asia as well as in Hong Kong itself. As Irving had shown, Canton's youth was greatly attracted to the Anglo-Chinese schools in Hong Kong, where they sat the Senior Oxford Examinations; a University would attract students not only from the Hong Kong schools but from all the English-medium colleges in China and from all the Anglo-Chinese schools in the Treaty Ports and Straits Settlements."
4,4,2,"Hong Kong's schools were already supplying China with officials, particularly successfully where a knowledge of English was an advantage. Half of the final pass-list after the first examination held in the newly-organized Imperial Maritime Customs Training College at Peking were Queen's College boys. The flow of the people of Hong Kong in and out of China, including students, was a fact of daily life."
4,4,3,"It could be said that the features of Hong Kong, considered as an entity outside China, lacked cohesion, defied the definition in terms of people and culture which readily distinguished Athens or Bangkok or London or Peking. The reason was, that practically everyone was expatriate. The small group of officials despatched to Hong Kong from Whitehall and by the Anglican and other religious missions, the garrison personnel and naval squadrons, the Western businessmen and professional people were no more expatriate than were the members of the large majority Chinese population itself. A Westerner returned on visits to his homeland less frequently, in general, than he visited China, and rarely had the occasion to be host to visiting members of his own family: it was he who was especially committed to a life in Hong Kong. The Chinese had little difficulty in keeping their family ties taut, on the other hand, for they were mostly connected with villages and towns in China at no great distance, within the jurisdiction usually of the Viceroys of the Two Kwangs and the Two Kiangs; they came and went with great ease and were able to renew their bonds, refresh themselves at their own source-waters, and return to Hong Kong to pursue a life which was no more than a slightly distorted extension of the lives their relatives were living across the border. The local fishermen were equally at home, of course, in any of the fishing ports along the South China coast. The first train ran the entire length of the Kowloon-Canton line on the 30th July Igl I: making journeys to China that much easier, and opening up an ever larger area from which Hong Kong would draw its expatriate Chinese population. It was the fact of this daily flow in and out of China which made Lugard's university project, for the Chinese of Hong Kong if not always for its foreigners, one of sound com- mon sense. When Lugard spoke at the founding ceremony in Iglo of the immeasurable influence the new University would have among the 400 millions of China, he believed, with every reason in the world, that this was a clear expectation."
4,5,1,"A sub-committee appointed to consider the constitution of the University reported in April 1gog, and having seen and compared in detail the charters of a great many universities in Britain, India, and the United States of America, recommended that the ordinance of incorporation with its supporting statutes, should be modelled on the charters of the Birmingham-Leeds-Liverpool group, slightly modified with reference to the Indian universities, but with the closest approximation to the charter of Leeds which was the smallest and newest. On the basis of this recommendation an Ordinance was drafted with a schedule setting out the details of organization in the form of Statutes. It passed into law on the 30th March 1 g 1 I, a good year ahead of the opening of classes, so that the University bodies might in the meantime be constituted and take in hand the detail of the agreement with the College of Medicine, the search for a Vice- Chancellor and teachers, the furnishing and equipping of the first buildings designed by Mody's architect and then rising from their foundations, the writing of a curriculum, and the myriad preliminaries needed to bring the substance to its shadow."
4,5,2,"A Court of forty members, including the whole Court of the College of Medicine, was its legislative and supreme governing body; a Council its executive. The Ordinance provided that all educational matters were in the hands of a Senate assisted by Boards of Faculties: but as these would comprise mainly teachers they could not be formed until a Vice-Chancellor and teaching staff were assembled. The Lugard preparatory committees stood thereby dissolved, save only that the fund-raising committee continued unofficially to function for some years. The terms in which the College of Medicine would cease to exist and be merged with the University as its Faculty of Medicine were set out; and in addition to Medicine there was to be a Faculty of Engineering; among other Faculties afterwards constituted, priority was to be given to Science and Arts, with due provision for the study of Chinese language and literature. The Governor and Chang J en-chun were designated the first Patrons."
4,5,3,"The first meetings of the Court and the Council were held both on the same day, the 28th April 1911. At its meeting the Court was presented with a statement of subscriptions to the Endowment Fund running to twenty-five pages. At this distance in time it is a most revealing document. The subscribers listed in it were mostly residents and associations and other groups in Canton, Wuchow, Newchwang, Amoy, Saigon, Penang, Australia, Macao, England, and Hong Kong; but also included were some officials in Peking and elsewhere. The grant of the site, which was Crown land, was approved by the British Government as its contribution, and by the time the foundation stone was being laid it had also secured a vote from its Treasury of £300 a year for the endowment of King Edward the Seventh Scholars, a token of its interest which Lugard believed to be quite without precedent."
4,5,4,"The statement is in three sections: the first details Chinese subscriptions, which include the proceeds of the two theatre performances, the $200,000 from the Viceroy of Canton, and a subscription from the Imperial Government at Peking, in all a little over $650,000; the second comprises Hong Kong subscrip- tions from non-Chinese individuals, banks, and trading and brokerage and professional firms, in total about $ 135,000; and the third is of subscriptions given in England by firms and individuals both in and out of the China Association and includes the founder of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and two former Governors of Hong Kong, in all $9,445 (£770). Separately from the three lists appear the donations ofJohn Swire and Sons and its two associated firms, the Taikoo Sugar Refinery and Ocean Shipping Company, which together amounted to $457,143 (£40,000)."
4,5,5,"The Chinese subscriptions in Hong Kong, in a spread between $20 and Ng Li-hing's magnificent gift of$50,000 transferred from the College of Medicine came in from a comprehensive range of its society. This section of the list sets out the donations offered by 210 individuals in business and professions and servicing industries, by seventeen banks, by four insurance and three shipping and shipbuilding companies, by eight opium, oil, cotton yarn, and California and Manila merchants, by three ironmongers, a fur dealer, five contractors, and five goldsmithies, by eight compradoring companies and eight piece-goods and other shops, by the Imperial Chinese Telegraph Administration, by 290 firms, companies, and hongs with activities undefined, and by three photographic studios including that of Ah Fong, who took and tinted the portraits of three of the major benefactors in 1912 and probably others in subsequent years for hanging in the Great Hall. Among the individual subscribers are 61 of the hundred members of Ho Kai's fund-raising committee. Other notables were the President of the Board of Posts and Communications in Peking, the Minister to the Court of St James in London, the Imperial High Commissioner for the Delimitation of Macau, the Taotai of the Tientsin Customs, and the ex-Taotai of Newchwang {Chow (later Sir) Shou-son.}"
4,5,6,"The same publication also details the subscribers to the equipping of the proposed anatomical laboratories, which were being constructed with Ng Li- hing's donation. Apart from a group of doctors and dentists, this subsidiary list is a quaint collection of forty-eight of the so-called guilds of Hong Kong. There are the food guilds, the dealers in rice, pork, flour, tinned and preserved foods, fish (variously salt, fresh, and fresh-water), dried fruit, sauce and soy, oil, vegetable and fruit, pigs, cattle, sheep, and tea, and the keepers of tea-houses and restaurants; there are the cloth guilds, the merchants in cotton yarn, piece goods, Shanghai silk, and cast-off clothes; there are the herbal guilds, running opium farms and trading in prepared medicines, foreign ginseng, tobacco, and medicinal herbs; there are the guilds of the artisans working in sandalwood, rattan, earthenware, gold leaf, and tin, the makers of straw and hempen bags, and the dealers in paper goods; there are guilds of the pawnbrokers and the Chinese bank and insurance brokers; there are the Kau Pat, Nam Pak, and King Pak (opium) hongs and a group of Tsui Li Tong compradores; there are guilds of the contractors, the theatre workers, the keepers of boardinghouses, the chandlers, the photographers, the purveyors ofkerosene, the California firms, and the import and export agencies; and one is left wondering what the Vermilion Guild could possibly have been, if it was not a guild of chop-ink mixers. In a range from below $80 to above $2,000, the weight of the Guilds' purse in support of instruction in the unspeakable intrusions of anatomical cutlery amounted to a little over $27,000 and in itsome of the subsidiary coins had to be sold at a small discount."
4,5,7,"Perhaps more than any other, this anatomy building thus bore the benediction of the man in the Hong Kong street. It was extended for the teaching of physiology in 1917 with a donation from Ho Fook. For its design and the supervision of its construction H. G. Fisher was the architect, and he gave his services free. It is now levelled to make way for new developments in engineering and science, since the old science and engineering buildings interfere with road- widening schemes. The patronage of the man-in-the-street from his pocket has given way to the patronage of the Government, which dispenses his taxes."
4,6,1,"At the University's first Council meeting Irving was continued as Registrar, a three-member standing Finance Committee formed with Chater as first Treasurer in the chair, and a miscellany of agents appointed--solicitors, auditors, bankers, and a consulting surveyor. So that instruments under Seal might be executed, including the agreement with the College of Medicine for a merger, a temporary Seal of rubber was approved, involuntary tribute to the flexibility displayed by the College in its approach to the requirements of the University project. The design for a permanent Seal with a matrix in steel, the Seal in use at present, was not approved until 19 I3."
4,6,2,"The search for its first Vice-Chancellor started. The office was of the greatest moment. Lugard had already privately offered it to Cecil Clementi, who had declined it in terms which revealed his utter disarray at the notion. Among others considered were Sir Atholl McGregor and the Chinese scholar R.F. (later Sir Reginald) Johnston. Johnston was well known in Hong Kong, having been in its civil service as a young man; in 1917 he became tutor to Henry Pu-yi, the abdicated emperor of China, and was given an honorary degree by the University in 1929. The offer was finally made, however, to Sir Charles Eliot, at the time first Vice-Chancellor ofthe new University ofSheffield, which had not long joined the growing group of civic universities in Britain."
4,6,3,"The Anglican Church and the London Missionary Society had reached various stages in the founding of affiliated hostels. The Council applied its talents to plans for the University's own two hostels (later named Lugard and Eliot Halls) and the setting of fees, to matriculation and admission, to selecting olive green as the University colour, to composing a motto, and to arranging for the University to manufacture electricity for its own use with its own plant."
4,6,4,"Some two months after the publication of the list of subscriptions to the Endowment Fund, the Chancellor announced that he had had a suggestion for a Fete and Bazaar, which might be organized to swell the Fund, promising that he and his wife would do everything in their power to make it a success. The University's first buildings were to be ready in February the next year, and the Fete could make an acceptable celebration to be combined with the Opening in March."
4,6,5,"On the 16th August 191 I, between reading reports of the momentous events then taking place in China, a 'general meeting of Chinese gentlemen interested in the University' assembled at Government House to embark on this heady exercise in corporate philanthropy, and nominated a committee of eighteen under the Governor's chairmanship to draw up the initial proposals. When this group met and discussion had revealed the financial size of the problem put to it, eight of them straightway undertook together to underwrite a total of $ I 0,000 to defray expenses, with a target of $100,000 profit on the undertaking; and one can but marvel at the telepathic negotiation which, in the sobering surrounds of Government House, these eighteen men must have employed to arrive at the decision, which eight of them were to lend how much each, and why. Their undertaking and other proposals were laid three weeks later before a meeting of the parent body, which proceeded to solicit cash gifts from everyone there, and then to choose an executive committee of thirty to carry the proposals for the Fete into execution."
4,6,6,"Eschewing the notion of inviting shops to lend their goods for sale on commission, which must have been the usual manner of stocking a fete charnpetre, the executive committee set to in every conceivable way to fill a capacious store with saleable articles, whether by simple gift or by seeking out cheap goods 'which would sell at greatly enhanced prices' (the middle distance has not much changed in the intervening seventy years) or by enlisting the nimble fingers of young school stitchpinnies to knot embroideries and otherwise smock, knit, pipe, and tat. Lady Lugard's London shopping talents were pressed into service to choose, pack, and have sent about 400 items, each worth perhaps $25; and the money left over was spent on local porcelain 'and other articles'. If the reader will pause and glance back at the list of subscribers to the anatomical labora- tories, he will forthwith face the full vista of mind-reeling motley hidden behind those innocent words: 'and other articles'."
4,6,7,"Entry to the Fete was to be by fee, and it would stay open for an entire week, day and night, each stall manned in shifts. Spaces around and between the stalls would be filled with attraction and entertainment, with peepshow, bioscope, display, and every other sort of pageantry. The Main Building and each available stick of the new University furniture were put at the disposal of the organizers. There would be a Scenic Railway and performances of Chinese opera and a firework display. A branch post office would be opened in the University for the first five days, with its own cancellation stamp. An attractive poster was designed for putting up in central locations in town. The enthusiasm of the Chinese gentry already amounted to almost fifteen thousand dollars by the end of the year, with more pronlised and still three more months to go; and a bulky store of bazaar articles was waiting and on its way by sea to be sold at sizeable profits."
4,6,8,"These breezy mobilizations were kept below fever point by the chill that blew into Hong Kong from China. The Chinese community was prompted by the reports of distress and famine which attended the political upheaval across the border, to open subscription lists in aid of relief work, a heavy enough burden on the purses of a commercial populace whose trade the revolution was thrusting rapidly into depression. By the time Christmas week came the Governor began to be apprehensive lest the Fete might need to be cancelled or postponed: but he was re-assured by his executive committee that it would be a popular and sweeping cash success."
4,7,1,"Revolution, remotely controlled by Dr Sun who was still abroad, started on the loth October Igl I with an accidental explosion in a revolutionary Hankow bomb factory. One of its immediate causes was said to have been the unification of the administration of the railway system, which had been put into hand after the reform edicts of Ig05 and Ig06. On the gth November the liberation of the province of Kwangtung from Manchu rule was announced, after fighting which produced riots in Hong Kong in support of the revolution. With the proclamation of an arnlistice at Hankow on the 7th December, the provincial majority declared themselves in favour of a republican form of government, and the next day Prince Chun resigned his Regency; the Chinese cabinet issued an Edict permitting the cutting of the queues which had become the symbol of Manchu rule, and the janitor of Queen's College promptly complained that the grounds were littered with the discarded hair of Hong Kong boys. "
4,7,2,"A Peace Conference was called in Shanghai in December between two plenipotentiary Commissioners charged with drawing up the peace terms between the Manchu rulers and the revolutionary government. Both were Cantonese, and both benefactors of the University. Prince Chun had recalled to power Yuan Shih-kai, dismissed from office as prime minister by the previous emperor, and had appointed his Cantonese colleague T'ang Shao-yi as the Comnlissioner acting on behalf of the Imperial Manchu Throne in Peking. The Commissioner for the revolutionaries and foreign secretary to the provisional republican government which had established itself in Nanking, was Dr Wu Ting-fang (alias Ng Choy) , the father-in-law of Ho Kai's daughter. He had been educated in Hong Kong, had acted as secretary to Viceroy Li Hung-chang at a time when he was Patron of the College of Medicine, was called to the bar in Hong Kong as the first Chinese barrister and appointed first Chinese member of its Legislative Council, and only a short while before had made a substantial donation to the University's endowment fund, with Tarn Kon-san having pledged $ I0,000 each at a meeting of the Canton Club at Shanghai on the 8th September. He was assisted at the Conference by Wen Tsung-yao, a distinguished former student of Queen's College. 'The people of China will accept no other form of government than a Republic founded upon the will of the people' \vas the theme of Dr Wu's opening speech at the Conference. T'ang, to the general consternation, expressed himself personally disposed for a republican creed as the only basis for a stable government, despite the official position he had been appointed to adopt. From the confusion created by his defection emerged the gigantic face-saving compromise, in which a Republic of China was created by Imperial Edict."
4,7,3,"While the Conference was in progress Dr Sun was on his way to Shanghai, being allowed to land in Hong Kong on the 23rd December for the first time in sixteen years; and on the 29th was elected provisional president of the new Republic of China."
4,7,4,"In command of the Imperial detachments of Kwangtung and Kwangsi in 1911 was Admiral Li Chun, who had been in Viceroy Chang's party meeting Mody at the end ofJuly 1909; it was he who surrendered to the revolutionary forces which, in the absence of Dr Sun abroad, were directed from Hong Kong by Han-min; and acting as guarantor offaith on both sides was Wei Yuk, whom we have seen as one of the University's earliest supporters."
4,7,5,"The Emperor's abdication followed early in 1912 under the protection of 'articles offavourable treatment', which permitted him to remain in his palace at the old imperial capital of Peking. In February Dr Sun felt it expedient to step down in favour ofYuan Shih-kai, who took up residence in his palace at Nanking, the new republican capital"
4,8,1,"The Opening ofthe University took placejust after lunch in the good weather of Monday the I Ith March 1912, after a weekend of furious, last-minute flurry; an event the presss spoke of as 'one which the entire community and in which many in the neighbouring country have taken the deepest interest, an interest which was manifested not only by the large representation of the European and Chinese residents at the ceremony itself, but by the thousands who gathered in the vicinity and who lined the approaches to the new seat of learning'."
4,8,2,"The Ceremony took place in the Great Hall, approached by the range of wide granite steps from beneath the front portico laid with a cloth of crimson and flanked with potted plants. The Hall was hung with bunting and streamers and red Chinese lanterns; on the platform Lugard sat centrally as first Chancellor, with the new Court ranged in a semi-circle around him. The first to speak was Mody's son, who announced that he was causing to be fashioned in silver a miniature replica of the Main Building for presentation to the Chancellor: memento which held pride of place in Lugard's drawing room in Abinger to the day of his death, but does not appear to have survived."
4,8,3,"Lugard's reply summed up the objects and functions of the University as they had developed in the four years of its conception and building, and the purposes which all the benefactors were subscribing to, including the Govern- ment with its recent vote of $14,000 a year 'as a Regius foundation'."
4,9,1,"It is two years almost to the day since we laid the foundation stone, and I sketched to you briefly the objects which I believed that the University was destined to fulfil. I said that it was intended to enable the richer among the Chinese to study in the environment of their own country, close to the ancestral shrines of their fore-fathers, and in touch with their own people instead of becoming denaturalized by long residence abroad, a benefit wealth cannot buy: that it is to enable those who have not the means to go abroad for a degree to obtain a first class education at little cost, while its scholarships will enable the very poor, who have ability, to acquire an equal degree. The passage of time since that date and the momentous events which have lately occurred in China, have caused me to hold the views I then expressed with ever strengthening conviction. Gentlemen, I am profoundly convinced that the opening of this University in Hong Kong today is an event of the greatest historical interest and importance in the annals of the Far East.... The graduates of this University will go forth into China with standards of life, with conceptions of duty, with characters and ideals formed during their training within these walls and the affiliated hostels. Just as they will speak English, so they will reflect the training received here from a British staff. China will no doubt have Universities of her own, but we are first in the field, and this University will grow under the free institutions of the British flag, enjoy- ing the benefit of association with the Universities of Great Britain. Its position and influence will be established, it will set a standard untouched as yet by any institution in China, and it may in its turn assist and guide the newer institutions. While our University will enable the boys of our own schools to complete their education, it will also welcome all, whether from China, from the Straits or other British colonies, or from the colonies of other Powers. Ofour own boys many will no doubt occupy high and responsible positions in China. Indeed, today we claim many of the men who stand foremost in the van of progress and reform in that country as alumni of our schools. But they completed their education elsewhere at the period in a young man's life which counts most in the formation of his character. In the future this will not be so. Was ever such an opportunity afforded to any nation as this comparatively small colony has, and which the foresight and acumen of its citizens have enabled it to grasp? ... I speak no idle words when I say that there are few things that I desire more earnestly than the success of the Hong Kong University. And not only of the University, but of its Hostels. A University is necessarily secular-its very name implies it-but the history of the greatest Universities shows us that their success has been invariably associated with the moral and ethical no less than with the intellectual training of their students. I will ask your indulgence if I speak somewhat frankly on this subject since in my view it is by far the most important with which we have to deal. The neglect to recognize its importance has led to disastrous results in other Eastern and African countries. This University, as I understand, has been founded to promote two distinct objects. On the one hand its secular teaching is intended to be eminently practical, in order to fit its graduates for spheres of utility, whether in engineering, medicine, commerce or administration. On the other hand this secular teaching is to be imparted under such safeguards and conditions of residence, of association, and of collateral influence as to ensure that the higher requirements of man's nature are neither neglected nor placed in the background. To all those agencies, whether they be Christian or other, which come forward toassist the University to fulfil its transcendent obligations in this most importantof all branches of education the authorities of this University will, I imagine,always accord a welcome. I speak in the presence of the representatives of manycreeds, but I speak not of systems of philosophies, or of creeds. I speak of thecontrolling force and guiding principle which ministers through creeds andsystems of philosophy to spiritual needs. The force of which I speak inspires manto a sense of duty, to unswerving integrity and loyalty whether in public orprivate relations of life. It is additional to, and greater than, the secular andutilitarian education of the class-room. It is founded generally on religioussanction, and finds its highest expression in the noblest of creeds. It is an essentialpart of the environment and atmosphere of any University fit to train and educatea nation, and I earnestly hope that it will be pre-eminent in this one. If I havespoken too long on such a theme, on such an occasion as this, I can only remindyou that this is the last opportunity afforded me to lay before those on whom theconduct of this institution will devolve in the future the supreme importance ofthis side of education, and to charge them to recognize it if they would avoidthose disastrous results which have elsewhere attended a higher education,subversive of ancient beliefs, and afforded without regard to spiritual and moralrequirements."
4,10,1,"The assessment of the local English press was that 'the harvest will not be immediate, but it will be sure and satisfying. It is not possible, therefore, to estimate how great will be the ultimate results, but it is safe to claim that they will be great. {Hong Kong Daily Telegraph, I I th March 19 I 2.}"
4,10,2,"The speeches were several, long enough, and followed with an Anthemcomposed especially for the occasion in the Latin words of the scholarly Cecil(later Sir Cecil) Clementi set to music and conducted by Denman Fuller, thecathedral organist, who had scored it for chorus, double quartet, and militaryband. Performing the Anthem was a well-rehearsed combination of the choir ofStJohn's Cathedral supplemented by the Hong Kong Philharmonic Society andthe brass band of the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry, who were supplyingthe garrison at the time. In the programme appeared not only the Latin wordsof the Anthem and their translation into English, but a Chinese version of itcomposed by Robert (later Sir Robert) Kotewall and a further English translationof that; it was later said, somewhat unkindly, that Kotewall's Chinese was soerudite that only he and Clementi could make it out. In 1930, after his return asGovernor, Clementi revised his Anthem to render it more suitable for permanentuse."
4,10,3,"The Thousands were waiting patiently outside for the opening of the Fete.There was some confusion about admission, which reduced the number attend-ing its first afternoon. But it was to the relief and resounding cheers of the waitingcustomers and to the accompaniment of fusillades of raucous crackers that theChancellor emerged from the solemnity of the Great Hall and proceeded to openthe Bazaar: whereupon the Thousands poured in and pounced on the stalls insearch of gay bargains, starting a week of flamboyant fun."
4,10,4,"The second day culminated in a grand banquet and concert in the GreatHall presided over by Lugard and attended by his great committee of a hundred,and others. The 'grand musicale' which ended the banquet was presented by allthe principal amateur talent of Hong Kong, opening with the previous day'sAnthem; one of the solo singers was the new Colonial Secretary Claud (laterSir Claud) Severn, just arrived in Hong Kong from Singapore, who made hislocal debut with Stephen Adams's 'Thora'. Bad weather marred the fun ofFriday's fair, even with the compensation of a grand firework display in theevenIng."
4,10,5,"The stalls were not as well patronized as had been hoped, and the Fete wasextended beyond the weekend to the following Tuesday, when articles were to besold at any price, some of the better being reserved for auction the next Saturdaynoon at the auction rooms of George Lammert. The most popular features of theBazaar were the Chinese theatrical performances and a fine Scenic Railwaywhich threaded its way around the stalls and along the hill, giving views acrossthe harbour to the hills of Kowloon and the Islands. After the Fete closed theentire railway apparatus was put up for auction. Since its financial possibilitieshad been recognized in several quarters bidding was spirited and it was sold for$10,000 to an unnamed Chinese buyer, who proposed to erect it elsewhere inHong Kong as a profitable undertaking!. The endowment fund benefited fromthe Fete in the sum of almost $35,000, mostly in small cash."
4,10,6,"On Saturday the 16th Lugard and his Lady were conveyed by sedan chair to St George's Hall in the City Hall, where a large public gathering had assembled to bid them farewell, their last public functions having been wholly in the cause of the opening of the University. 'Any man', it was reported, 'might well be proud of such a coping-stone of his career' {dem, 11th March 1912.}"
5,0,0,Scholars by Examination
5,1,1,"SIR CHARLES ELIOT took his seat in the University Council for thefirst time in]une 1912, at a meeting presided over by Claud Severnin the place of Lugard, whose formal letter resigning as Chairmanwas read. The profits of the Bazaar were noted at the meeting anda decision reached to make an offer of appointment as professor of civil andmechanical engineering to C. A. Middleton Smith, to occupy the first full-timeChair in the University."
5,1,2,"Eliot had been succeeded at Sheffield by H. A. L. Fisher, one of England'sforemost historians, and was himself a man of quite extraordinary intellect andscholarly diligence, with interests ranging between the forms and history ofBuddhism and the Samoan sea-slug. His memory was not inaptly compared tofly-paper, to which any fact alighting stuck for all time; with this came a specialfacility in languages for which, in the Latin oration for his honorary degree atOxford, he was dubbed a Mezzofantius alter) which indeed he was, havingtwenty-seven languages at his command, including Chinese, and the distinctionof publishing the first Finnish grammar in English."
5,1,3,"Before going to Sheffield he had risen in the foreign service to be, ascommissioner, virtually the first governor of British East Africa at the timeLugard in the West was high commissioner for Northern Nigeria{ It is interesting to note that, at this time too, Lugard's private secretary was Henry Gollan,who while chiefjustice of Hong Kong (as Sir Henry) acted for a brief time in 1930 as the Univer-sity's Vice-Chancellor.}. He had inAfrica, it was said, revealed himself as a man of action, open mind, and broadvision. Among his close friends he had a reputation for wit. Most of all, he wasan observer of keen insights, and his wit was of a sort that took the form ofcomment when he was contemplating, in recall, what he had observed. Whenamong those he did not know he was inclined to be shy and silent. He was likedby the students, and their fondness for him lived on in future generations longafter he left, for when he returned to Hong Kong in 1924 to receive an honorarydegree, he 'was mobbed by an excited crowd of undergraduates, hustled into a motor-car, and to his infinite discomfort and embarrassment, drawn in processionthrough the streets of the city'l. One of Eliot's tales of his life in the East recountshow an eastern oculist completed a thorough examination of his eyes 'with thegrave but superfluous warning: ""You will be all right if you do not stand onyour head"" '. Indeed, all who knew him, even standing on his feet, remarkedhis lack of visual sensibilities; he observed and contemplated the meaning oftruth, but not of beauty. He was credited with designing the Vice-Chancellor'sacademic dress in its early form, later to be described by Hornell as 'amazinggarments ... on the lines of the vestments of some high Buddhist ecclesiastic'.Hornell, naturally, had them changed. It was quite unlikely that he designed theUniversity coat of arms, as Middleton Smith later wrote; for he would not havebeen capable. Nor was he a man much used to manipulating figures, regardingthe problems of accounts and estimates as something of a necessary nuisance; alack perhaps not easily acceptable in the first Vice-Chancellor of a newly-established University with a large purpose but little money. At least he was notplagued in Hong Kong, as he had been in Sheffield, by a Board of Educationavid for statistics. That Board, he once complained to Michael Sadler of Leeds,'want to know how many hours the Professors lecture. Nothing so ungentlemanlyhas been done by the Government since they actually insisted on knowing atwhat time Foreign Office clerks arrive at Whitehall'."
5,1,4,"In the preface to Hinduism and Buddhism, the monumental work on which hehad been engaged for some years, 'I cannot share', he wrote, 'the confidence inthe superiority of Europeans and their ways which is prevalent in the West',and it was in this spirit of humility that he set about his task in Hong Kong. Hisknowledge of written Chinese was already abundant; this he supplemented withdaily doses of tuition in spoken Mandarin. His summer vacations he spent inPeking and in other cities in China, also for the language, but principally seekingto establish scholarships in his new University and asking for more money for itsendowment. His reputation as a scholar, the sort of quiet tenacity with which heunhurriedly pursued his objects, and the liberality of his views, touched cords ofsympathy in the Chinese; the friends he had himself made during his visit in1907, as well as the friends of the University itself, brought him a ready hearingeverywhere. Before he left Hong Kong in 1918, it was said that there was at least one student at the University from each of China's eighteen provinces and, thoughI have found no precise evidence of this, it was substantially true. In his speechat the first degree Congregation in December 1916, the Chancellor said 'Wehave at present two hundred students and it is most gratifying to know thatamong them eight Provinces of China are represented'."
5,1,5,"The assembling of teachers and students at the standards set in the ordinancewas a task worthy of no lesser man. For the selection of teachers in the initialstages there were the universities in Britain to draw upon, the Home CommitteeLugard had set up, and machinery in Whitehall well known to Eliot himself,which could be relied upon to help in the search and in making preliminaryarrangements. But students were another matter."
5,1,6,"The terms set out in the Statutes and attached to large donations given forendowment provided the University with a basic scholarship system, though ofa strange kind. Donors of specified sums were empowered, if they wished, tonominate up to four scholars for tuition-free places, provided the scholarsnominated met the requirements. Donor scholarships reached a total of 70. Thusselection of a fairly large proportion of the entries in the early years was in thehands of the University's financial backers; the scholars selected were almost allHong Kong boys from the Anglo-Chinese schools, which had for some yearsbeen preparing pupils for the Senior Oxford Local Examinations, specified inthe Statutes as adequate for admission purposes."
5,1,7,"Statements vary of the number of students who entered classes when thefirst term opened in the autumn of 1912. The fact is that the University startedat much the same size as the first Imperial University of Peking, with 7I studentsof whom 17 were seniors from the College of Medicine, 17 were in first-yearmedicine, and 37 were in the first year of a four-year engineering curriculum.New entrants to medical classes were adn1itted to residence on the 14th Septemberand engineering on the 15th October, and seem to have been all local students."
5,1,8,"If the University was to start fulfilling its purpose, however, it would need to seek in China and elsewhere for other supports for the radials of its web of learning."
5,2,1,"The University formed the strategy for its attacks on the problem of aidingin China's educational renascence. In the peculiar position of Hong Kong as anintegral part of China's land-mass with a large population of people who movedfreely in and out, to maintain and improve the standard of the secondary schoolsof Hong Kong itself and supply the need of graduates in these schools, in theprofessions, and in the public service would be automatically a service to Chinaalso, as His Excellency Wei Han had implied at the foundation-stone layingceremony. But this was not enough."
5,2,2,"The University's object must be to place into responsible positions both inHong Kong and in Chinese institutions men (and later, women) who had completed in Hong Kong a University education in the medium of Englishexplicitly equivalent in standard to that offered in the civic universities foundedin the industrial cities of the north of England; and as a subsidiary object to dothe same for other areas in Asia where there were Chinese communities."
5,2,3,"One of the first needs, achieved in 1913, was to add Arts to the two foundingFaculties of Medicine and Engineering, which I shall treat of further on in thisaccount. The other was to get students from China into the University atacceptable standards of entry, in addition to a regular entry from Hong Kongschools."
5,2,4,"There were two different sources in China's schools. There were the studentstaught in English in the Anglo-Chinese schools, all run by the Christian missionsexcept a handful in Shanghai maintained by the Municipal Council. And therewere those taught in Chinese in the middle schools and colleges. The Anglo-Chinese schools were already aiming to enter their pupils for the Oxford orCambridge Local Examinations. The pupils of the Chinese schools were some-times presented for the district and provincial examinations, which were stilllargely traditional in content and form, but into which mathematics and thesciences were slowly being fitted."
5,2,5,"A standard level of admission was achieved by instituting a single Matricula-tion Examination, to be conducted both at Hong Kong and at oversea centres.The oversea centres opened avenues of direct contact with the Anglo-Chineseschools; and their students were saved the expense and inconvenience oftravellingto Hong Kong for an examination. The first examination held in Hong Kong wasin December 1913, and from then until the December examination ceased in192 5, in December and July each year. This new examination took the place ofthe Senior Oxford Local in Hong Kong schools from 1914. It was also to be held,but in July only, in any coastal port where not less than five candidates presentedthemselves, the first of the oversea centres being opened at Canton in 1914. Inseveral of the main cities of China the University appointed agents to act for itin a variety of capacities, including the organizing of these centres. In citieswhere there was no agent, the willing principals of schools were pressed intoservice, or a member of the staff was sent to make the arrangements. Clearly,centres for an examination conducted in English were required only where therewere Anglo-Chinese schools to serve; and it was particularly welcomed by themnot only because it was set in English, but because the syllabuses were designedto be somewhat more appropriate to the Far East than those of the Oxford orCambridge examinations. The responsibility for selection from these schools thusrested wholly with the University."
5,2,6,"For pupils from the Chinese schools in China, on the other hand, pre-Matriculation classes were needed particularly in English and in some cases inmathematics, general science, geography, and Western history. The Universitywas prepared to offer these itself as preparation for the examination, but it could do this only in Hong Kong. The Chinese central and provincial Governmentswould need to be persuaded to found scholarships, for which they would selectthe scholars themselves to come to Hong Kong and attend pre-Matriculationclasses and the subsequent examination, in a Hong Kong centre."
5,2,7,"This was a set of problems much to Eliot's taste, for it meant travelling. Hisfirst Christmas vacation he spent visiting Nanking, Shanghai, Hangchow, Foo-chow, and Amoy accompanied by his Registrar, W.]. Hinton. In a report onhis return he said he had been the rounds of the municipal schools at Shanghaiand met most of the leading Chinese there and at Nanking, and was confidentthat large numbers of students would ultimately come to the University fromShanghai, though at present there were not many who had reached the requiredstandard: even so, he expected the beginning ofa trickle in 1913. At Foochowhe had called on the Anglo-Chinese College, St Mark's School, and some othersas well as the commissioner for foreign affairs; as a result of the visit severaleducators had already been to Hong Kong to see the University for themselvesand had gone away impressed with what they saw. At Amoy they had managedto spend only a few hours over the New Year, but enough for him to be clearthat the schools he visited there, especially the Anglo-Chinese School, 'wouldprove most valuable feeders to this University'. He intended visiting Swatow andAmoy again in March; and the Registrar had received many enquiries from theStraits Settlements. His conclusion was that the University could 'look forwardto the hearty co-operation of the teachers on the Coast, and to receiving a grow-ing number of students from as far north as Shanghai and as far south asSingapore'. The negotiations produced eight government engineering scholarsfrom the province ofChihli in 1914, of whom five graduated in 1918. The Boardof Communications in Peking agreed to accord facilities for engineering studentson the Canton-Kowloon railway plant, and to send engineering students onscholarships from the north on the understanding that one in every ten would begiven a tuition-free place by the University."
5,2,8,"In summer 1915 Eliot made another trip to Hankow and Ningpo, and thenin September to Canton, where the Civil Governor announced the intention ofthe Provincial Government of Kwangtung to establish 25 scholarships worth$300 a year each, five to be back-dated from]uly 1914 for some Canton studentsalready admitted, and the remainder to take effect in December. The Presidentof the Republic then announced that he had founded five President's Scholarships'for encouraging learning', each worth $400 a year for five years, of which thefirst year was to be devoted to preparatory work. The enrolment for 1915 showsseven new Kwangtung scholars admitted; and other records state that LieutenantF. C. Millington was appointed to instruct some new scholars from KwangsiProvince for ten hours, and others were appointed to instruct new Governmentscholars from Peking for six hours a week, in the first of the pre-Matriculationarrangements for scholars untutored in English. That year, too, a special entrance examination was held for the Peking and Chihli Government scholars. The flowfrom China had begun in earnest."
5,2,9,"This student flow was not, however, matched by a corresponding cash flow,and by 1915 the University was in financial trouble. The summer after he hadarrived Eliot had sent Middleton Smith over to England to make arrangementsfor the transport of machinery promised by British firms, to buy and beg othernecessary equipment, and at the same time to see if anything might be done todivert some of the Boxer Indemnity millions into the University's purse for thepurposes of the Faculty of Engineering, supplying him with letters of personalintroduction, to the Prime Minister among others. First he made representationabout the Boxer monies to Lord Curzon, but was not received with any greatenthusiasm. It was suggested with a cold callousness, Middleton Smith recalledin some embarrassment, that he should first discuss his errand with engineeringemployers in Britain, to discover if they would be prepared to swallow the grantof several millions of pounds in order to further educational work in China.Discuss it he did, but without effect. Smith then called upon the Lord Chancellorfor support, and a case was prepared for Parliament. In the event, the reply wastransmitted through the usual Government channels that nothing would be done.But backed with encouragement from Lugard, and with a dinner party or twogiven by Lady Lugard, Smith did succeed in collecting equipment and somesmall donations before his return. The British share of the Boxer Indemnitiescontinued to be a University target until it was finally unhoarded in 1931; andthe lines of the University's pursuit of this glittering treasure are tracedbelow."
5,2,10,"Had it not been for a generous response from a benefactor then in KualaLumpur to the cry for help, the University might well have foundered at thistime. In 1915 Loke Yew offered an interest-free loan of $500,000 which was tobe repaid in full in 1936. As a condition of loan four free places were to bereserved from 1916 for scholars from the Federated Malay States and the StraitsSettlements, the start of a regular connection with the peninsula which has heldever since. For the examination that year a centre was also opened at Penang."
5,2,11,"Eliot was at Peking in the summer of 1916 and, given the occasion to talkwith the President of the Republic about the University, was struck by the detailwith which he was questioned, particularly the methods adopted in the Univer-sity to prepare young men for the public service. As a practical indication of thesincerity of his interest, the President had ordered the continuation of hispredecessor's scholarships, and sent a special message of congratulation on theoccasion of the first congregation for the conferment of degrees held the followingDecember. In the Christmas vacation of 1916-17 Eliot set out again, this timefor the Straits Settlements, Kuala Lumpur, and Java; in Kuala Lumpur takingthe opportunity of conferring an honorary degree upon Loke Yew, and inSumatra upon Cheung Iu-hing, an early benefactor of the Faculty of Arts."
5,2,12,"The Government of Siam had begun sending scholars in an experimentwhich led in 1918 to the despatch there ofRichard Ponsonby-Fane, the Governor'sSecretary and a friend of the University who helped in the pre-Matriculationclasses, to discuss the detail of more permanent plans, with the result that fiveSiamese scholarships a year were founded from 1919."
5,2,13,"The Provincial Government of Kwangsi announced in March 1917 theaward of ten scholarships from February the next year. Lieutenant Millingtonwas retained to prepare the scholars for the July Matriculation Examination, buthe seems not to have been able to perform this task as they had not arrived whenthe July Examination started. The Provincial Government cabled to say it wassending 50 selected candidates to sit for it, nonetheless, and a special examinationhad therefore to be organized for them in September, at which in the event onlyseven candidates presented themselves, none able to pass. Provincial Govern-ments were not the easiest to deal with. Even the next year a summer class hadto be held after the examination had finished and a special entrance examinationset in October for eighteen of the provincial candidates."
5,2,14,"As an encouragement to the Anglo-Chinese schools the University itselfestablished four free scholarships for indigent pupils, two in the Sacred HeartCollege at Canton, and two in the Wesleyan College at Fatshan; and followedthese with similar scholarships in the Tientsin Anglo-Chinese College, and onescholarship each awarded in Wesley College at Wuchang and Griffith JohnCollege at Hankow. The Shanghai Municipal Council invited the University tomake regular inspections ofits schools from 1917, a chore the Registrar undertookfrom time to time, alternating with an education lecturer. The MatriculationExamination was becoming a major element in the educational life of Shanghai.Henry Lester of that city offered a Hong Kong scholarship of $650 a yearrestricted to pupils ofMedhurst College entering the examination at the Shanghaicentre; and the next year Edward Ezra bequeathed two, similarly tenable bypupils of schools in which the Shanghai Municipal Council had an interest."
5,2,15,"Before Eliot left in 1918, the Yunnan Provincial Government had joined inan educational alliance with the Hong I(ong Government, the Hong KongChamber of Commerce, the British American Tobacco Company, and Messrs.Shewan Tomes to award nine scholarships annually on open competition worth$ 1,000 a year each for pupils of schools in Yunnan; and the following year theYunnan Government added two on its own account on condition that theUniversity would arrange pre-Matriculation tuition. The year after, Hupeh sentscholars. Subsequently several ofthe Chinese Government agencies reviewed andconfirmed these scholarship arrangements, but to what extent the records thatare extant offer no precise detail. In 1922 an anonymous donor in Shanghaifounded two Peace Memorial Scholarships for British boys living in China, foraward on the results of the Matriculation Examination. The degree examinationlists for May 192 I reveal that out of a total of 194 sitting, 71 were from overseas: n China there were 16from Canton, 6from Yunnan, 7 from Chihli, 8 fromHupeh, 1 from Wuchang, and the number of Peking and President's scholarscombined were 22; from Siam there were 3 and from the Straits Settlements 8."
5,2,16,"In 1918 Eliot was once more in Peking, this time discussing the possibilityof training teachers for Chinese Government schools, and securing an immediateresponse with a promise of twenty scholarships tied to education, to be awardedthroughout China."
5,3,1,"To take the place of the Junior Oxford examination in the Hong Kongschools as preparation for the new Matriculation examination the Universityintroduced in 1915 two new schools examinations, a Senior and a Junior LocalExamination, each held twice annually in a wide variety of subjects, and theGovernment of Hong Kong made it obligatory for all Government and aidedsecondary schools to enter pupils in their top forms to the three of them, arequirement which remained in force until the examination reorganization of1934 {The University still has the records of individual performances of school-children at all ofthese examinations, and they would repay the sort of detailed investigation I wish I had time tomake. They show in precise detail the growth of the effect they had, not only locally, butthrough the Far East generally. They are still referred to, even the earliest of 1913, but chieflyas providing proof of residence in Hong Kong when it is untraceable by other means.} In level they were one and two years respectively below that of theMatriculation Examination. These examinations sapped much of the energy ofthe staff of the University, despite the aid of teachers from the schools. Theteaching staff was 33 in number, more than half accounted for by the Faculty ofMedicine; and their small number subjected them to tasks often on mostunfamiliar ground. Professor Kenelm Digby, the first professor of anatomy andlater of surgery, we find examining in domestic science, and most relieved whenthe second professor of physiology, H. G. Earle, agreed to share the examiningwith hinl on an alternating arrangement from 1917. Carving and the use ofcutlery could be said, of course, to be familiar ground to the anatomist and thesurgeon. Eliot himself examined in Mandarin."
5,3,2,"As the University's activities in China and elsewhere grew, there arose ademand for more than the Matriculation Examination; the out centres startedaccepting candidates for the Senior and Junior Local Examinations. Thisinevitably led to the opening of centres at which only the Junior Examinationwas set, with the object of aiding the English-medium schools in the vicinity toprogress through the Senior to the Matriculation Examination itself. We mustremember that there were still few schools in China capable of bringing theirpupils up to the standards required for entry to Western universities, not onlylinguistically, but in mathematics and the sciences."
5,3,3,"These examinations were important tools, perhaps the most important, forthe University's tasks; and as the centres spread they formed a sort of spinal column that stretched from North China to Java, creating a most potent forcein the establishing of uniform standards in the English-medium schools for theChinese mostly, but also for Indians, Portuguese, Eurasian, and English pupilsall through China, Malaya, the Straits Settlements, and Java and Sumatra, aswell as Hong Kong itself. From 1919 the members of the Matriculation Boardmet twice a year with the principals of secondary schools in Hong Kong, and thesort of consultation which was developed in these meetings was applied inShanghai, where the Registrar called two meetings in March 1922, one attendedby the principals of the eight Shanghai Municipal Council schools enteringcandidates for the examinations, and the other by three principals of non-Municipal schools. By 1927 the University was examining over 1,000 schoolchildren between the ages of fourteen and sixteen at levels straddling the threesenior years of schooling, at various times in some fifty schools in Amoy, Canton,Hankow, Hanyang, Hong Kong, Fatshan, Foochow, Ningpo, Shanghai, Tientsin,and Wuchang; in Ipoh, Kuala Lumpur, Malacca, Penang, and Singapore; andin Batavia, Samarang, and Soekaradja-in schools which relied upon theUniversity for their syllabuses and standards, and in whose educational develop-ment, therefore, the University played a far from inconsiderable part {One of the attractions for me, when I first joined the University in 1946 after havingorganized, as a member of the temporary civil affairs administration, its first postwar entranceexamination, was the prospect of travelling in China and South Asia reopening Matriculationcentres-an expectation soon enough rudely shattered.examiningsystem in Hong Kong during this period, before returning to Sir Charles Eliotand his successors.}. For them,the examinations were invaluable as a set of standard and independent tests ofattainment. This sort of annual public examining exercise may no longer findmuch favour among the free-wheeling educationists in modern developedcountries, but in the decades which followed revolution in China, and in whichlarge areas ofAsia were seeking to achieve stable educational systems, it providedthe 'governor' which kept at least the English-medium part of the educationalmachinery turning steadily. It laid the solid foundations upon which wholesystems of English-medium universities were later erected. It was in my opinionthe largest single contribution the University made to the region as a wholeduring the period before the Sino-Japanese War of 1937-44. I may therefore beforgiven if I complete the picture of the development of the school "
5,3,4,"Eliot, as we have seen, took a particular interest in the spread of theUniversity's influence through its school examinations and the provincial scholar-ship system; the third Vice-Chancellor, William Hornell, was equally interested,and travelled from time to time himself on Matriculation business. InJune 1927he was at Samarang investigating an irregularity which had threatened theexanlination's security. In passing, it is of interest to see in his report that he remembered the University's having been asked in 1924 to nominate a head-master for the Chinese High School there, and that he had heard the graduatenominated was doing well. One wonders how young this headmaster was, as hecan scarcely have been more than about 27 and may have been even a fewyears younger."
5,3,5,"This same year the University, with a readiness that seems strange in thelight of the burdens it was already carrying, agreed at the Hong Kong Govern-ment's request to conduct an entirely different kind of school examination. Thiswas to be for the Government Vernacular Middle School opened in 1926, to bein the medium of Chinese, and to start at the end of1927; and on its results somestudents were admitted to the classes in the University in English and Chinese,but only as external students and not permitted to proceed to the internalexaminations. The University continued to conduct this examination at least-the records are not clear-until 1932 and probably much later, but always 'onthe distinct understanding that it is purely a school leaving examination'."
5,3,6,"By 1929 the number sitting the three English-medium examinations hadgrown to 1,500, from all areas. 'The conduct and management of these examina-tions, which are held at various centres, not only in China, but also in Malayaand in Java, imposes a considerable strain on the University office staff',complained Hornell, 'and on those professors and lecturers who set and examinethe papers.' A complaint of this nature must have gone against the grain forHornell, as the previous year the examinations had shown an income of $26,000,of which $10,000 was profit. But the total full-time teaching strength was stillunder 40, including those in the medical faculty, whose patient-care commit-ments, the necessary adjunct to clinical teaching in hospital wards, were increasingyear by year. And there were problems connected with the provincial scholarships.In the Christmas vacation that year Hornell travelled to Nanking in companywith Professor C. Y. Wang-the University's first Chinese professor who died atthe tragically early age of 4 1 only a few months later-in an attempt to persuadethe central governnlent to restore diminishing provincial scholarships. It is likelythat they met with only limited success. Certainly, in order to maintain itsconnection with Yunnan, the University itself founded a Yunnan scholarship in1934, which it had to suspend in 1941."
5,3,7,"The Hong Kong Government agreed to a reorganization of the schoolexamining system in 1934. Previously, it had been obligatory for all secondaryschools in which the Government had a direct interest to enter their pupils forthe examinations conducted by the University. The University was requested toconduct a new school-leaving examination separately from the MatriculationExamination, at the same level but more appropriate to the end of a schoolcareer than to the beginning of undergraduate studies. The University consented,but at the same time decided to discontinue its own Matriculation Examinationand base its admission on the results of the new examination. The opportunity was also taken to alter the academic year, which had since 192 I been runningfrom January to December, so that it might conform with the school year andstart in September."
5,3,8,"In 1937 there was a further change in Government policy. For the first timeit entered the examining field at the secondary level itself, and organized a schoolcertificate examination to mark the end of normal schooling at the level of thefifth form. This gave the University the chance to give up entirely the respon-sibilities for school-leaving standards that it had borne for a quarter of acentury, and in 1938 it revived the Matriculation Examination and confined itsactivities in the schools to that alone. The burden of examining was dramaticallylightened for the staff; in the period between 1938 and 1940 the number ofcandidates being examined in the Matriculation Examination levelled out atabout 400. These changes of policy removed much of the University's influence,of course, in the development of Anglo-Chinese education in China and SouthAsia, though it continued to open centres for the Matriculation Examinationwherever they were required. In 1941 the Matriculation Board expressed thewish to open a centre at Chungking in 1942, if the Chinese Government raisedno objection and suitable arrangements could be made-which of course theycould not"
5,3,9,"In the thirty years to 1941, the University had examined some 25,0001school pupils, probably about a third of them outside Hong Kong. Examinationquestion papers and the detailed results of each candidate have all survived."
5,3,10,"The first groups of the scholars selected from among these examinees werehoused, temporarily, on the top floor of the east wing of the Main Building until1913, when the first University hostel up the hill, named Lugard Hall, was readyfor occupation. A quarter close by them was arranged for the first of the Wardens,Dr Francis Clark. He was to occupy his quarters free of rent, and a suggestionhad been made in the Council that he might have been quite convenientlyhoused in a matshed for the time being. A medical student writing in TheCaduceus in 1922 offers a view of Francis Clark in 1914, when he was just fifty:'The old members of the University can still remember with what ease a haleand hearty old gentleman used to negotiate the steep paths leading to the hostels'.Provisional recognition was granted as early as June 1912 for students to live ina hostel being put up by the Anglican Church Mission Society on Bonham Roaddirectly opposite the Main Building, and thirty of them were thus the first tomove into rooms designed for the purpose in StJohn's Hall. The recognition wasconfirmed a few months later when an extension to the Hall was ready. TheLondon Missionary Society, which had had such close connections with the College of Medicine through the permanent staffof the Alice Memorial Hospital,erected a hostel on the opposite side of and above the University estate andopened it in September 1913. When this Morrison Hall first opened its doors tostudents a letter written by Warden H. R. Wells that September reveals that onlyone student entered; by the New Year, however, he had been joined by twenty-one others, three of them Christians. Six months later the University's connectionwith the London Missionary Society was strengthened still further when theSupreme Court gave its consent to the removal from the City Hall, to become apermanent feature of the University's library, of the entire contents of the libraryof Dr Robert Morrison, an early Society missionary and first translator of theBible into Chinese. The Society'S hostel was itselfgiven Morrison's name in 1916.In 19 I4 Eliot Hall, the University's second hostel, was completed and its third,May Hall, in 1915. In all there were then something under 300 residential places,and no further accommodation for men was built until the Society of Jesusaccepted students into Ricci Hall in 1930. The first hall for women students,St Stephen's Hall, an Anglican hostel, was opened in 1923{ See Irene Cheng, nee Ho Tung, 'Women students and graduates' in The First 50 Years,1962, pp. 148- 158.}"
5,3,11,"The Anglican secondary school for boys on Bonham Road, St Stephen'sCollege, continued to be intimately concerned with the University's developmentfrom the day on which Lugard first advocated the idea of his university at its prizeday in early 1908. William Hewitt, the first Warden of St John's Hall, andArchdeacon Barnett, the Warden of 8t Stephen's, were leading figures in theAnglican mission. They both wanted to see an arts faculty established swiftly2.Hewitt had been told that the Council would not be able to start an arts curriculumbefore October 1913, and there were several pupils at St Stephen's who would beentering the University in 1912 but only if there were arts courses. His andArchdeacon Barnett's enquiries had indicated that an entry of twenty could beexpected if a faculty were established. After talking it over with Eliot thatAugust, Hewitt prepared a paper setting out what he called provisional arrange-ments, in which St John's Hall could undertake for an additional fee to offerfirst-year lectures in English, history, and Chinese, and the students would attendthe University's first-year lectures planned to start in mathematics, economics,and political science with the intention that they would be examined and readyto progress into the second year of a new arts faculty by October 1913. Hethought it would be possible, in the event of any financial difficulty, to obtainguarantees for $10,000 a year for five years against the cost; and expressed himself'sanguine that the amount received in fees would be so considerable that theguarantors would not be called upon to take up their obligation'."
5,3,12,"Hewitt was invited to attend a meeting the same month for discussion, andwith Eliot was asked to find the guarantee as proposed, but for five years from1913, 'to ensure the establishment of an arts faculty without loss to the U niver-sity'. If this was forthcoming no guarantee would be required for the provisionalyear of 1912-13. It was the Registrar's view that 50 to 60 students would beneeded by the second year, and that outlets for graduates would be the ChineseCivil Service, including teaching in the provincial schools, and that if there weregreater specialization in commercial economics, some would enter the commercialworld. It was not until January 1936, however, that the Executive Yuan formallydeclared the University's graduates eligible to appear at the higher civil serviceexaminations. A new arts faculty was also to include the courses in physics andchemistry required by the other faculties, and there was some initial discussionof the prospect of including international and constitutional law. From this rangeof subjects suitable groupings could be made for a four-year arts degree curricu-lum. The guarantors comprised Hewitt and Barnett and ten Chinese benefactors,at least six of whom had been closely associated with Lugard in the process ofestablishing the University-Sir Kai Ho Kai, Ts'o Seen-wan, Wei Yuk, Au ChakMan, Chau Siu-ki, and Kwok Siu-lau-and they asked that not only law studies,but ethics and moral philosophy should be included as soon as possible, to meetone of Lugard's stated objects, which was the direct teaching of a code of morals.Eliot had interviewed the men proposed as lecturers but was not wholly satisfiedthat history would be suitably covered-and this accounts for his own participa-tion in the history course, for which he lectured in Chinese history from thefollowing year."
5,3,13,"On the 6th September 1912 the Council accepted the guarantee andproposals. The addition of arts courses had been accomplished within one monthof Eliot's preliminary talk with Hewitt, and after details had been worked outarts students were admitted as a late entry in the University's first year. Theformal institution of a new faculty had to await the opening of the second yearand came into effect in October 1913 as planned, but on somewhat securergrounds than had at first been expected. For in May of the previous year CheungPat-sze, who had raised $90,000 in 19°9-10 from the residents of Weichow forthe endowment fund and was a foundation life member of the Court, joined withhis kinsman Cheung Iu-hing, the Chinese consul in Sumatra where they hadlarge business interests, promising together the sum of $60,000 to be paid inmonthly instalments of $1,000 over a period of five years, to provide for a starton courses in economics, commerce, finance, economic history, and law in a newFaculty of Arts. Thus were its birth and an infant health ensured."
5,4,1,"In addition to the spread of public examining through the region, thegarnering of scholarships, and the formation of a Faculty of Arts, Eliot's termwas marked by all those preliminaries which can be attributed to hard work and pressure, the assembling of a young and keen staff, and a mounting local interestin the rather grand institution Hong Kong had given itself. The General MedicalCouncil of Great Britain had extended its recognition to the medical degree atthe outset, in itself a propitious start."
5,4,2,"Under Eliot's gentle persuasions, the three Ho brothers, Robert Ho Tung,Ho Fook, and Ho Kom-tong became prominent benefactors in order of theirseniority, which also, in the manner of the Chinese, determined the sizes of theirdonations: Ho Tung donating $I 00,000 in 19 I 5, half of it for the general endow-ment and half to be applied to a chair of clinical surgery at the GovernmentCivil Hospital; Ho Fook extending the anatomy building which had beencompleted in 1913, with a donation of $50,000 given in 1916 to accommodatephysiology, and also settling the bill for a fine Mace in silver gilt and encrustedwith jade; and Ho Kom-tong joining with the family friend Chan Kai-ming indonating $50,000 each in 1917 for a combined building in which tropicalmedicine and pathology might be taught."
5,4,3,"Master's degrees on the results of examination of theses in arts and engineer-ing were instituted in 1916, the year in which the University conferred its firstbachelor's degrees at a congregation. For the further needs of the undergraduatesEliot launched appeals the same year for building funds, setting targets whichLugard's fund-raising committee speedily met, its widespread tentacles still atthe University's disposal when required. One was for the erection and furnishingof a sports pavilion on ground assigned by the Government the year before, forwhich Ho Kwong1, Ho Fook's eldest son, led the public subscription list, to theeffect that the Pavilion was opened that year. A building was needed for theStudents' Union, which was for the time being accommodated with most of theother amenities in the Main Building, and the target of $50,000 was met withthe help of Sir Paul Chater, Professor G. P. Jordan, and others; the new Unionbuilding itself was opened in 1919 after Eliot had left and while Jordan was actingas Vice-Chancellor."
5,4,4,"In 1918 Eliot was offered appointment for one year as High Commissionerin Siberia and prevailed upon the University to release him to undertake theassignment on secondment. The following March he asked for the services ofProfessor W. J. Hinton, then Professor of Political Economy and previously hisRegistrar, to be Commercial Counsellor in Siberia and secured Hinton's second-ment for some months. On being offered appointment as Ambassador to theCourt ofJapan Eliot resigned from the office of Vice-Chancellor on the 26thSeptember 1919, while still away"
6,0,0,Postwar Confrontations
6,1,1,"AFTER ELIOT'S RESIGNATION, his successor was not appointed for overa year. Professor G. P. Jordan was Pro-Vice-Chancellor and up tothat point in time had been running a successful medical practicein town, though the affairs of the University were making increas-ing demands upon his time. He agreed, reluctantly enough and probably undersome pressure applied by his uncle the Treasurer, to turn his attention fully tothe University and act as Vice-Chancellor during the period of Eliot's absencein Siberia and thereafter until Sir William Brunyate arrived to assume the office.The University's earliest graduate, Dr G. H. Thomas, had received his firstprofessional fees from Jordan for assisting with a patient, and recalling the yearswhen he was a schoolboy at the turn of the century remembered him"
6,2,1,"in the prime oflife and at the height ofhis fame as the leading medical practitionerof the colony. He was particularly popular with the Chinese community, whoalmost worshipped him. His name was mentioned with awe, respect, and affec-tion. No one who was really ill could afford not to consult him at least once. Hispersonality was no less remarkable than his reputation. He was stout and of shortstature, but he possessed a magnificent head and a confidence-inspiring counten-ance, enhanced by his striking moustache and his deep resonant but soothingvoicel {Bulletin of the Jordan Memorial Library r.i, 15th September 1941.}."
6,3,1,"His moustache was waxed, of the variety known as 'handle-bar', and all of seven inches from point to point."
6,3,2,"Jordan was confronted with acute financial problems from the start. Eliothad revealed one quality he held in common with his friend Sir Michael Sadler,who as Vice-Chancellor had been 'gaily budgeting for a deficit' at his Universityof Leeds {Sir William Brunyate in a speech to the Court on 20th December 1921.}, relying on the Treasury or the local authority to bail him out fromtime to time. Jordan appealed to his Chancellor to intercede with the Government for a grant with which the University might meet an accumulated deficitof$570,000 and add one million dollars to its endowments. A meeting was calledat Government House and the position of the University discussed, a few daysbefore Sir Reginald Stubbs sailed in to assume the Governorship. As the resultof this, at its meeting early in 1920, with Chancellor Stubbs in the Chair, theCourt refused to accept the accounts for 1918-19 and threw out the estimatesfor 1919-20 which were providing the Council with its authority for dailyexpenditures, requesting that the Governor-in-Council appoint a commission toinvestigate the whole dismal financial picture. The Governor appointed acommission headed by a prominent local barrister, E. H. Sharp, K.C. Its reportwas made to him confidentially in April, but never published; it revealed clearlyenough how justified was Jordan's appeal for a rescue operation, for the Govern-ment announced the next September that it would meet the deficit, grant amillion dollars for endowment, and from 1922 increase its annual grant fron1$20,000 to $50,000 a year, a sum which ""vould meet about 15°1<> of the University'srunning expenses. Jordan's brief and harrowing tenure of the reins of officebrought, for the first time, an admission from the Government that it had anysubstantial interest in the University it had set up by legislation in 1911"
6,3,3,"Selected for the office by Lord Milner, the Secretary of State, Sir WilliamBrunyate arrived to relieve Jordan in January 1921, and by the end of the yearJordan was dead at the age of 63. His uncle Sir Paul Chater endowed a libraryin the Students' Union in his memory, opened by his widow in September thefollowing year. It was well furnished, and though it lacked 'the quiet atmosphereof the University Library, its chairs are far more comfortable-a fact whichseems to have been very quickly apprehended by some students. Strangely, andit must be admitted, unfortunately, the Jordan Memorial Library is the only partof the Union Building in which may be found slumbering undergraduates'{Union MagazineNovember 1931.}"
6,4,1,"Sir William Brunyate, the second Vice-Chancellor, came to the Universityfrom Egypt, where he had been in the Government service for some twenty-threeyears, the last five as its judicial adviser. He had had no intimate contact withthe academic world since leaving a fellowship at Cambridge in the 1890S andproved a remote, forbidding figure, at least to the students. When he arrived hefaced a staff demoralized by financial uncertainty and lack of clear policies. Hisbrief occupation of the office-it was only three years-was marked particularlyby determined attempts to secure a solid foundation for the University's finances."
6,4,2,"The Government's response to Jordan's appeal for help encouraged animmediate response among the University's friends in the community. AtBrunyate's first Court meeting in 1921 there was not only report of the Govern-ment's rescue operation, but also of donations of $100,000 each from H. M. H.Nemazee a Persian merchant, John Swire and Company, and Robert Ho Tung,respectively for the general endowment, for the endowment of the Taikoo Chairof Engineering, which had been the first chair founded under statute in 191 I,and for the construction of engineering workshops; a sum from Mok Kon-sangfor the endowment fund; and promises of payments in instalments made forcommercial studies by the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce whichwere continued until 1933, and by K wok Chun-yeung for Chinese literaturecourses over the next ten years."
6,4,3,"The search for scholarships occupied part of Brunyate's first sumnler, withtravel in the Federated Malay States and the Straits Settlements, whose govern-ments offered education scholarships for pupils undertaking to serve as teachersafter graduating from the University; in the same pattern the Hong KongGovernment also offered a number of education scholarships. He negotiated thecontinued interest of the Metropolitan Government at Peking and the ProvincialGovernments of Hupeh, Chihli, and Yunnan with the award of twenty-two newscholarships, and from the China Medical Board at Peking, the arm of theRockefeller Foundation in China, secured eight medical scholarships for awardto pupils of the Canton Christian College."
6,4,4,"His correspondence with the Rockefeller Foundation had given him somehope of settling the problem of appointing to two full-time chairs in the Govern-ment Civil Hospital, and the following year to one in the new Tsan Yuk maternityhospital, which when it was completed was put under the University's directcontroP. A general appeal for funds, which was to be launched as one result ofthe Sharp Commission report, had not been officially started when Brunyatearrived, and he deliberately delayed it until his negotiation with the RockefellerFoundation was concluded. He believed that any grant the Foundation madewould contain the condition that it should be matched by contributions madelocally, and this would affect the terms of the public appeal. The Hong KongGovernment had in the meantime pronlised $400,000 towards the appeal whenit was launched. Brunyate expected to hear the conclusions of the Rockefellertrustees early in 1922."
6,4,5,"In December he had visited Shanghai to address the Associated BritishChambers of Commerce, and reported that that body had adopted, by awardingscholarships, a positive policy of encouraging schools in China to send pupils tothe University. He had returned full of confidence in the University's work,provided its finances could be put on a solid foundation. The debate in the Courtthat followed was dominated by the force of Brunyate's convictions, and he hadsome points to make that were especially interesting coming as they did froma newcomer to the Far East: Undoubtedly there has been a very great interest in education in China in thelast year or two and it has extended to our British merchants. It has been putto me that a British or other hard-headed merchant, unless he sees his moneycoming back to him will not give. Well, one gives from mixed motives, and I amquite prepared to believe that business men may criticize moral values ratherclosely when their pockets are in question. As to the view that the matter is oneof pure propaganda, I certainly gave no encouragement to any such policy atShanghai. As I stated quite frankly, I had been in Egypt and seen much educa-tional propaganda on the other side; it really embarrassed us very little andnever seemed to me worth the money spent on it. If I may venture to express myown opinion, I met these men at the Conference-and a very pleasant time itwas-and the impression they gave me was that they were men very much likethe rest of us, capable of the same enthusiasms and idealism, who did believe itwas not the proper thing to come to China to make money out of her andcontribute nothing to her moral development, and that education was the rightlines on which to help. That is my explanation of why these men are backingthis University, and if they are doing so I suggest it is because they believe inthis University. After all, it is only four years since our real graduates began toleave us. Well, I have met schoolmasters from whom these boys came as far apartas Hankow and Penang; I have met the men employing them, and I can saythey are pleased with our graduates. Employers are satisfied with your graduates,that is the real reason why they are prepared to support this University.What will the effect of that be? In the first place it will entitle you to makea wider appeal than you can as a local body. If you like to put yourselves at thehead of British education in China, you can have that position and make thewider appeal. You will, I believe, see scholarships being founded to send pupilshere, you will find the schoolmasters on your side, and they will increasinglyrecommend their boys to come here, and you will have the advantage of theirmoral support, which is a great thing in education. On the other hand, you willhave very much increased responsibilities; instead of being responsible for justsuch a University as there is money for, you become bound to have a Universityworthy of the great traditions of British trade in China, and that, I admit, is abiggish responsibility. I say you can have position if you like to accept it; becausethe real decision is with the Court. I felt, at Shanghai and Hankow-and atPeking, where I was earlier-that perhaps I was going a little further than I wasentitled to as Vice-Chancellor, but decisions had to be taken and I hoped thatI should be supported by this Court. If you want a satisfactory University in thisColony, it is the Court that is going to create it. Don't run away with the ideathat because you have got a few gentlemen that are paid for the purpose, some-where out on the Pokfulum Road, they will create a University for you. The mostwe can do is to advise you as to how the money you put at our disposal shall bespent, and do what we can for you in our own way. But if the University has insufficient funds it is not our responsibility either. And it will fail if it hasinsufficient funds, and also if the feeling of the Colony is against it and unless ithas the backing of this Court. I say this because, while I am prepared to do mybest as your technical adviser and executive officer, I know I cannot do verymuch without your support ...·.. it has not been a question in the past of having a cheap University but ofhaving anything worthy of the name of University at all. You cannot do it onthe sums you tried to do it on when this University was founded. That you havedone so well is extraordinarily creditable to your staff. And now, as Vice-Chancellor, I will budget to the last penny of what I have available, but I willnot guarantee that the University is efficient on its present resources; it is notand it cannot be. That has been generally recognised ...·.. Our men are a great deal better than you had any right to expect. Here inChina it is especially important. I do not want to use the word 'research', buttake a question like political economy. What is the good of bringing anyone outto teach English political economy or English political science to Chinese boys?You must have men who understand what is going on in China; you must havemen of broad outlook, who can give you in the end students fit to take their placeas leaders in China. It may be according to the men you choose whether yourgraduates or someone else's are leaders in China, and if they are leaders it maydepend on the men you choose whether they are good or bad leaders-which iseven more important ...The Chancellor's reply was·.. that we, in this comparatively small Colony, with much of the populationnot above the level of poverty, cannot afford to maintain a University to supplythe whole ofChina with leaders, good or bad. Ifthe University were for Hongkongonly it would be a very small affair and probably the Government could supportit, but if it is for the whole of China, then the whole of China has got to begin byputting its hand in its pocket and assisting it. I do not wish to discourage thegenerosity of inhabitants of Hongkong in that matter, but I must say I think it iswiser that the appeal should be made to a very much wider community thanHongkong if it is to be a success. There is the vexed question of the BoxerIndemnity.... As far as I am concerned, I confine myself to writing regularlywhenever an opportunity presents itself urging that the British Governmentshould follow the example ofthe American Government and devote the indemnityto the education of the Chinese on British lines, in Hongkong and elsewhere."
6,5,1,"The Court formed an Appeal Committee headed by Claud Severn, theColonial Secretary, with E. H. Sharp and Lau Chii-pak. The last two died thatyear before the draft of the appeal document could be made and Brunyate madethe draft himself and had it endorsed by the Finance Committee."
6,5,2,"In January 1923 the Rockefeller Foundation indicated that it was preparedto support a programme of medical expansion, and the Vice-Chancellor drewup his proposals in detail for the University Council. Before they were transmittedto New York a visit by Edward, Prince of Wales, was announced, and theUniversity sought agreement for him to be given an honorary degree. Arrange-ments were then made for the degree to be conferred at a special congregationon the 7th April and Brunyate seized the opportunity to ask the Foundation forswift action so that the grant might be announced on that occasion. The daybefore the Prince arrived the Foundation cabled a pledge to endow chairs inmedicine and surgery in the sum of half a million Hong Kong dollars just in timefor the announcement to be made at the congregation. The grant contained nocondition that a matching sum should be raised locally, as Brunyate hadexpected, and the fund was available for drawing three months later. Theimmediate effect was that the Chair ofAnatomy was divorced from Surgery, andDigby took the Chair of Surgery; a full-time Chair in Medicine was establishedand a decision taken to create another in Obstetrics and Gynaecology as soon aspossible; and lectureships and tutorships in these subjects were created. TheFoundation declined to accept a proposal that the Chairs should bear the name'Rockefeller'. In a moment of euphoria Brunyate told the Court that 'we havea finer, a more promising institution than I myself had entirely realised. Onedwells on the shortcomings of the place', he confessed, 'and one forgets what weare really accomplishing. We are, I believe, an outstanding institution in Chinaand are recognized as such increasingly and very generally'."
6,5,3,"In a letter written on the morning of the 8th June 1922 to the Director ofthe Foundation, Brunyate spoke with some pride of a congregation that was totake place that afternoon for twenty-nine graduates: 'The record number up todate. Eight of the degrees are medical. The new graduates are dining with metonight. Four of them are Peking Government students, the first of these studentsto graduate. Four more are Chihli Government students, and four CantonGovernment. Some six are from the Straits. Two are from Australia. It is aninspiring assortment'."
6,6,1,"The European War had made no great impression on the life of Hong Kongexcept to create a few shortages, and less on that of the University. One of itseffects in China was the reversion to the Chinese Government of German andAustrian concessions, and their related Boxer Indemnities. The Russian conces-sion passed into her hands following the collapse of the Czars, on a promise ofagreement made in 1919 but not signed until 1924, and this also includedremission of the Russian portion of the Indemnities. America had alreadyremitted its share in the form of scholarships to the United States and theestablishing of preparatory colleges in China."
6,6,2,"As a feature of the clearing-up process after the War, when disarmamentand the protection of national interests were major issues, a Conference wasconvened at Washington in November 1921 largely concerned with the Far East,and was used by the Americans as a means of containing Japan's continuingambitions in China and elsewhere. Belgium, Britain, China, France, Italy, Japan,the Netherlands, and Portugal were represented. Among its results was therestoration by Japan of its Shantung properties and a number of assurances givenby Britain including the surrender ofWeihaiwei, which it accomplished in 1930."
6,6,3,"Of the Boxer Indemnities, some countries agreed to the suspension ofpayments through permanent remission, under conditions which were to earmarkthe remitted sums for specified purposes, being largely the education of theChinese and the purchase in the remitting countries of materials for the enlarge-ment of the Chinese railway system. In 1922 the British Government decided toremit the whole of its portion of the Indemnities, provided the remitted sumswere devoted to the mutual interests of Britain and China, particularly witheducation and trade in view. What sort of conditions Britain would favour, wasthe question uppermost in the University's thoughts at this time; and if highereducation formed one of the conditions, what were the chances of the University'splaying a major part, offulfilling its role as the pivot ofBritish interest in Chinesehigher education, backed by funds of this sort of magnitude. Lugard moved inwith a letter to The Times on the 4th January 1923 urging the application ofBoxerFunds for the University's development. The stakes were high."
6,6,4,"At another conference in Shanghai called by the Associated Chambers ofCommerce early in 1923 to discuss their view of the disposal of the Boxer Funds,Brunyate was there to put the University's case. Proposals for the disposal of thefunds had included, as well as education and railway extension, river conservancymedical work, and sanitation: all formidable contenders. The outcome of thediscussion failed to move the British Government towards any final decision; andthe time, if ripe for decision at that moment, within two years became no longerso, as relations between the two countries were rapidly deteriorating."
6,7,1,"Brunyate was compelled to announce to the Court in April 1923 that hisappeal had been ineffectual, chiefly because of competing appeals; but that fora variety of reasons, prime among them the Rockefeller endowments, the financeswere for the moment sound enough: sound enough indeed to continue carryingquite considerable debts owing by China to maintain its scholars in the Univer-sity. The Peking Government alone owed almost $5°,000: 'They tell us frankly',Brunyate offered in defence, 'they have no money at present: they are in thesame position in regard to students in Japan, in France, and in Great Britain.They will pay us when they can'. The Peking Government was not alone. 'I donot know', said Brunyate, 'whether members of the Court realise how difficult itis for the Chinese Central and Provincial Governments to find means of payment for quite small debts. We have quite a number of scholars from the ChihliGovernment. Some of them graduated the other day, and they have sent ussome more ...."
6,7,2,"At the same meeting he announced his intention to retire the followingspring before his term was completed, saying that he had already set in motiona search for his successor through the Universities Bureaul {The following month the University appointed the Secretary of State to act as agent for therecruitment of its teachers in Britain. This odd arrangement continued, with correspondenceabout individual appointments conducted by means of official despatches between the Governorand the Secretary of State, until 1932when the task was officially taken over by the UniversitiesBureau, now the Association of Commonwealth Universities.}. The timing of hisdeparture was dictated partly by personal reasons, but also because he felt it wasjust about the time when he could usefully hand over to a new man, since 'thatis just about the time when the Boxer policy will have to be decided, and it willbe for him . . . to carry any policy decided upon through', a reasonable enoughprophecy at the time."
6,7,3,"The Treasurer Sir Paul Chater left for England on the 4th May, and onlya few hours before leaving handed a cheque for $250,000 to the Chancellor as alate response to Brunyate's appeal the year before. He had delayed making thedonation, he said, since he was afraid that 'an earlier gift might suggest somethingof the nature ofa bargain', having been given an honorary degree in 1922. WhenChater returned Brunyate went to see him to suggest 'that it would be a verysuitable thing if his name were connected with one of our Chairs. It may be thathe was following the precedent of the Rockefeller Foundation, but he expresseda preference for leaving things as they were'. The sum was invested in mortgagesin Shanghai and the income applied that summer to offers of enhanced salaries.It has been asserted from time to time, with what truth I do not know, that someof these mortgages were contracted with the owners of bawdyhouses-nourishingthe spirit with the fruits of the flesh, as it were. When Brunyate left the followingFebruary he felt that Chater's gift had been a personal vindication of his tenureof office, in which a superannuation scheme had been introduced and highersalaries offered to the teachers. One of his last duties was to make formal applica-tion to the Rockefeller Foundation for a quarter of a million dollars to create aChair of Obstetrics and Gynaecology; and another to welcome an offer fromFung Ping-shan to swell the endowment fund by a further $50,000."
6,7,4,"Writing later in the Union Magazine for 1933, Ponsonby-Fane thought thatBrunyate, however devotedly he had worked, had been temperamentally unsuitedto be a Vice-Chancellor, had lacked the necessary tact and urbanity of manner,and had 'found it difficult, if not impossible, to unbend'."
